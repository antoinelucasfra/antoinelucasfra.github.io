## What is Quarto?

Quarto is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system that lets you create:

- Documents (HTML, PDF, Word)
- Presentations
- Websites and blogs
- Books

It supports multiple programming languages including R, Python, Julia, and Observable.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Download Quarto from [quarto.org](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/).

### Your First Quarto Document

Create a file named `report.qmd`:

````markdown
---
title: "My First Report"
author: "Antoine Lucas"
date: today
format: html
---

## Introduction

This is my first Quarto document.

```{{r}}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Car Weight vs. Fuel Efficiency")
```
````

### Rendering

```bash
quarto render report.qmd
```

## Key Features

### Code Execution Options

```yaml
#| echo: true      # Show the code
#| eval: true      # Run the code
#| warning: false  # Hide warnings
#| fig-width: 8    # Figure width
#| fig-height: 6   # Figure height
```

### Cross-References

Reference figures, tables, and sections:

```markdown
See @fig-scatter for the visualization.

```{{r}}
#| label: fig-scatter
#| fig-cap: "Scatter plot of weight vs mpg"
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point()
```
```

## Benefits for Data Science

1. **Single source of truth** — Code and narrative together
2. **Multiple output formats** — One document, many formats
3. **Reproducibility** — Anyone can re-run your analysis
4. **Version control friendly** — Plain text format works well with Git

## Conclusion

Quarto is an excellent tool for creating reproducible data science reports. Start with simple documents and gradually explore its advanced features.
