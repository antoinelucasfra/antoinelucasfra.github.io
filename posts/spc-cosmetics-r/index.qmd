## Introduction

Statistical Process Control (SPC) is essential for maintaining consistent product quality in cosmetic manufacturing. This post demonstrates how to implement SPC charts using R.

## The Basics of SPC

SPC uses control charts to monitor process behavior over time. Key concepts:

- **Center Line (CL)** — The process average
- **Upper Control Limit (UCL)** — CL + 3σ
- **Lower Control Limit (LCL)** — CL - 3σ

## Implementing Control Charts in R

### X-bar Chart Example

```{r}
#| eval: false
library(qcc)

# Sample viscosity measurements from production batches
viscosity <- c(
  4520, 4535, 4510, 4525, 4540,
  4515, 4530, 4505, 4545, 4520,
  4525, 4510, 4535, 4515, 4530
)

# Create groups (5 samples per subgroup)
groups <- rep(1:3, each = 5)

# Create X-bar chart
qcc(viscosity, type = "xbar", sizes = 5)
```

### R Chart for Variability

```{r}
#| eval: false
# R chart for within-subgroup variability
qcc(viscosity, type = "R", sizes = 5)
```

## Detecting Out-of-Control Conditions

Common patterns to watch for:

1. **Points beyond control limits** — Immediate investigation needed
2. **Run of 7+ points** — Process shift detected
3. **Trends** — Gradual drift in process
4. **Hugging the center line** — Possible measurement issues

## Creating an Automated SPC Dashboard

```{r}
#| eval: false
library(shiny)
library(qcc)
library(ggplot2)

# Simple Shiny app structure
ui <- fluidPage(
  titlePanel("Production Quality Monitor"),
  sidebarLayout(
    sidebarPanel(
      selectInput("product", "Select Product:",
                  choices = c("Moisturizer A", "Serum B", "Cleanser C"))
    ),
    mainPanel(
      plotOutput("controlChart")
    )
  )
)

server <- function(input, output) {
  output$controlChart <- renderPlot({
    # Generate control chart based on selected product
    # ... chart generation code
  })
}
```

## Conclusion

SPC is a powerful tool for maintaining quality in cosmetic manufacturing. With R, you can automate monitoring and quickly detect process issues.
