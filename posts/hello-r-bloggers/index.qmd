If you're arriving here from R-Bloggers, welcome. This is a quick orientation.

I'm an applied statistician and ML engineer based in Paris. For the past five years I've
been embedded in R&D and clinical teams — at L'Oréal, Sanofi, a microbiome biotech, and
currently Chanel Parfums Beauté — building data pipelines, statistical models, and ML
systems in environments where reproducibility and auditability are not optional. R is
my primary tool for statistical work, reporting, and Shiny applications; Python handles
the ML side. Most posts here are field notes from that work: things I've worked out in
production and thought worth documenting, for my future self as much as anyone else.

The R content on this blog is practitioner-focused. You'll find posts on reproducibility
in GxP-regulated environments, statistical methods applied to real formulation and
clinical data, and R tooling that has earned its place in my daily workflow. Not
beginner tutorials — notes from actual use.

**Three posts to start with:**

- [Building Reproducible Analyses in Pharma with R](/posts/reproducible-pharma-r/) —
  how I structure R projects in regulated environments, from `renv` to audit-ready
  reporting
- [rv: The Modern R Package Manager for Reproducible Workflows](/posts/rv-modern-r-package-manager/) —
  a look at the Rust-backed package manager that is quietly replacing my `renv` workflow
- [Staying Current in a Fast-Moving Field: Why I Built a Resources Catalog](https://antoinelucasfra.github.io/posts/why-curate-resources/) —
  on curation as a practice, and the catalog of 200+ data science resources I maintain

The [full blog listing](/blog.qmd) has everything, filtered by category.
