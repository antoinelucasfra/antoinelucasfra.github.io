## Introduction

This guide provides a complete and reproducible path to installing R & Python along with a fully configured VS Code setup. It's meant to be definitive and fully reproducible.

## First you need to install R :

-   Recommended way : you can install R via rig which is an installation manager https://github.com/r-lib/rig

With rig you can very easily install multiple and handle different R versions.

-   you can follow the classic R installation via CRAN https://cran.rstudio.com/

## Then you need to install python :

-   follow classic python installation, python is probably already available if you are with a linux system http://python.org/downloads/

-   we recommend also to install pipx to handle python libvrary installation https://github.com/pypa/pipx

## then we need to install our favorite IDE for developing

Here we VERY strongly recommend using vscode which allows a complete flexibility for developing in various languages (not only in R) : https://code.visualstudio.com/

You can use any other IDE (Rstudio, Pycharm, etc...) but only the configurations of VScode will be developed, feel free to search for your own guides & issues for other IDEs.

## Now we can install various tools for moden development

In R, we are using installation with a modern oriented development workflow.

To finish installation in vscode to have a complete R integration you need to follow the following steps : - follow R & vscode https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/r

For this, we will be having various tools to ensure this workflow :

-   first we'll be using quarto for authoring, reporting and produce deliverables https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/ and you can install quarto vscode extention

-   We can also install quarto wizard on vscode to healp us easy to use quarto extensions https://github.com/mcanouil/quarto-wizard

To follow good principles of development, we'll be using tools to ensure that everything is on track :

For formatting/styling code :

-   air for formatting R code https://posit-dev.github.io/air/editor-vscode.html (alternative to styler)

-   ruff for formatting python code https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/

-   prettier for any other languages https://prettier.io/

For linting in both R & python you have the errorlens extension that is very complete and useful https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items/?itemName=usernamehw.errorlens

For notebooks in python :

-   if you want to use notebooks, we strongly recommend using https://github.com/marimo-team/marimo to write in notebooks

-   otherwise there's still the classic jupyter alternatives https://jupyter.org/

There's infinite possibilities for vscode extensions, please install them according to your needs and care for trusted publishers. Here's an example command to list your installed extensions:

```bash
code --list-extensions
```

For reproducible environments and library to manage and handle we have :

-   uv in python, which is a (COMPLETE AND SUPERIOR) alternative to pyenv and other python pkg management tools https://docs.astral.sh/uv/

-   renv to handle R pkg management which is the most common admitted tool to use in R community BUT there's a new tool in town called rv https://github.com/A2-ai/ that is meant to be the uv for R
