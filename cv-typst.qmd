Biostatistician & Data Scientist with 5+ years building production-grade data solutions in
regulated industries — pharma, cosmetics, and biotech. Expertise spans statistical modelling,
Design of Experiments, applied ML (computer vision, NLP), and multi-omics analysis. Proven
track record translating complex scientific questions into end-to-end systems: from study
design and model development through to validated deployment and stakeholder training. Strong
communicator bridging wet-lab science, software engineering, and business.

## Experience

**Data Scientist & ML Engineer** — *Chanel Parfums Beauté R&D · via Astek / IT&M Stats*
*Sep 2025 – present*

- Designed and deployed computer vision models (texture classification, colour analysis) and NLP pipelines (olfactory descriptor mining from scientific literature) for fragrance and cosmetics formulation R&D
- Modelled sensory and physico-chemical properties with PLS regression, Gaussian processes, and Bayesian optimisation to accelerate ingredient screening cycles
- Built DoE workflows (mixture designs, response-surface methods) cutting required experiments per formulation cycle by 30–40%
- Engineered MLOps infrastructure: model versioning with DVC, drift monitoring, fully reproducible pipelines (Docker + GitHub Actions) in a GxP-adjacent environment
- Delivered R Shiny dashboards covering sensory scoring, spectral data visualisation, and interactive experiment planning for R&D scientists
- Responsible for data science platform tooling: Azure ML, Posit Connect, Databricks — provisioning, access governance, and lifecycle management
- Owner and maintainer of a 20+ app catalog (R Shiny, Streamlit) used daily by R&D scientists

**Data Scientist — Internal & Consulting** — *Astek / IT&M Stats*
*May – Sep 2025*

- Developed reusable internal R packages and Quarto automated reporting templates, cutting analyst turnaround time by ~25% across consulting engagements
- Led internal upskilling programme on tidymodels, causal inference, and reproducible research for 8 statistical consultants
- Scoped and prototyped ML solutions for pre-sales client engagements in pharma and agri-food verticals
- Fine-tuned a Phi-3 LLM (Microsoft) on open Hugging Face datasets for fake news detection and climate claim proof retrieval — full pipeline from data preparation to evaluation

**Data Scientist — Multi-omics** — *Abolis · Microbiome Studio · via Astek / IT&M Stats*
*Dec 2024 – May 2025*

- Fast-paced 8-person startup contributing to a SaaS product (FastAPI Python backend, Vue.js front-end), with full individual autonomy
- Delivered end-to-end pipelines in R and Python for tabular and large-scale omics data (genomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics)
- Applied PERMANOVA, sparse PLS-DA, and co-occurrence network analysis to characterise microbial interactions and identify key functional drivers
- Integrated analysis outputs into the production SaaS platform via REST API

**Data Scientist / Scrum Master** — *Sanofi R&D · via Astek / IT&M Stats*
*Jul 2023 – Nov 2024*

- Architected and delivered a full R Shiny platform (golem) managing pilot manufacturing chains for 100+ GxP clinical projects — 50+ daily active users across 3 departments
- Designed the data model, module architecture, and automated validation report generation to satisfy GxP audit-trail requirements (IQ/OQ/PQ on Posit Connect)
- Owned the full delivery lifecycle: user-story workshops → agile sprints → UAT → IQ/OQ documentation → production deployment
- Sole developer on the engineering side, working directly with 5+ senior sponsors across R&D and manufacturing
- Mentored 1 intern on building Shiny application modules

**Biostatistician** — *L'Oréal R&D · via Astek / IT&M Stats*
*Oct 2021 – Jul 2023*

- Delivered 100+ statistical analyses on ingredient efficacy (hydration, anti-ageing biomarkers) and molecular safety (QSAR, genotoxicity) across cosmetic and dermocosmetic pipelines
- Designed and analysed clinical and semi-clinical studies from protocol writing through regulatory-grade reports — consistent 2-week delivery cycle
- Built internal R tooling (survival analysis, mixed-effects models, automated Rmarkdown reporting) adopted as standard across the biostatistics team
- Mentored 2 junior analysts and 1 intern; co-authored methodology guides on non-inferiority testing and adaptive designs
