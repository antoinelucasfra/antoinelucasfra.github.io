Dear AI for Health Team at Google DeepMind,

I am writing to apply for the Research Engineer position within the AI for Health team at Google DeepMind. I hold an engineering degree in applied statistics and mathematics from Institut Agro (Agrocampus Ouest) and have spent the past five years building production-grade statistical and machine learning systems embedded in R&D and clinical teams — at L'Oréal, Sanofi, Abolis (a microbiome biotech startup), and currently Chanel Parfums Beauté. That trajectory has given me something I believe is genuinely rare among ML engineers: deep fluency in both experimental science and software engineering. I understand what a regulatory team requires from an audit trail, what a researcher means when a model is "not biologically plausible," and what it takes to deliver systems that are not only technical but deliver real value in daily scientific workflows.

On the technical side, I have designed and deployed end-to-end pipelines integrating deep learning, LLM fine-tuning, structured data extraction, and GxP-grade infrastructure. My work spans the full lifecycle — model development, pipeline architecture, evaluation frameworks, and the reproducibility infrastructure that keeps research systems maintainable at scale.

I am particularly drawn to the AI for Health mission at Google DeepMind because it represents the most consequential application of that philosophy: building ML systems that are scientifically rigorous, carefully evaluated, and designed to be used by researchers working on problems that matter. I would welcome the opportunity to contribute to that work.

Yours sincerely, Antoine Lucas
