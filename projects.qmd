A selection of data science and ML engineering work I've done and am able to share publicly. Most of what I build is under non-disclosure agreement (NDA) or involves proprietary data — client work, production tools for fragrance R&D, clinical data platforms — none of it can be shared. This is the part that can be.

More projects are in the works. In the meantime, the blog is a better indicator of what I'm actually working on.
