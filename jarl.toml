[lints]
# Currently using lintr defaults as the baseline.
# Uncomment and customise rules as the migration from lintr progresses.

# Example rule overrides:
# assignment_linter = "error"        # enforce <- over =
# line_length_linter = { length = 100 }  # match air.toml line-width
# object_name_linter = "warning"     # snake_case enforcement
