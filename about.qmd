## How I got here

I didn't start out planning to become a data scientist. I studied agronomy engineering at AgroParisTech — which is fundamentally about applying science to complex living systems — and during my statistics courses I realized that the analytical side was what excited me most. Not just running models, but understanding *why* a method works, and what it can and can't tell you about the real world.

After finishing both my engineering degree and a master's in applied mathematics and statistics in 2021, I joined **Astek / IT&M Stats**, a consultancy that places statisticians and data scientists inside large R&D organizations. That structure has shaped how I work: every 12–18 months, a new domain, a new team, a new set of constraints. It forces you to get good at context-switching, at earning trust quickly, and at building things that work without you being there to explain them.

My first mission was at **L'Oréal R&D** — two years of clinical biostatistics on ingredient efficacy and molecular safety studies. I covered hundreds of analyses, learned what a 2-week turnaround really means under pressure, and built internal tooling that helped the team move faster. It was a good introduction to regulated science: the kind of work where you can't hand-wave uncertainty.

Then **Sanofi R&D**, where I shifted from pure analysis to building. I designed and shipped a full R Shiny platform for managing pilot manufacturing chains across 100+ clinical projects — took on the Scrum Master role alongside the development work. That was the project that taught me that *useful* software is harder to build than *correct* software.

After Sanofi, a stint at **Abolis**, a microbiome biotech startup. Six months, full autonomy, multi-omics data pipelines, no hand-holding. Very different energy from a pharma company, and I learned a lot from it.

Now I'm at **Chanel Parfums Beauté R&D**, working on machine learning and computer vision for fragrance and cosmetics development. Still on mission via Astek/IT&M Stats, but this is the most technically ambitious role so far — models that go into production, tools that scientists depend on daily.

## What I care about at work

**Working at the interface, not the edges.** The most useful position is between the domain experts (chemists, clinicians, biologists) and the data/software systems. People who sit purely on one side often build the wrong things. My agronomy background genuinely helps here — I can read a protocol, understand an experimental design, and push back when the question being asked can't be answered with the data available.

**Tooling that disappears.** The best internal tools are the ones that become invisible — people just use them. A dashboard that requires a walkthrough every time is a failed tool. I spend a lot of time thinking about UX in contexts (scientific apps, internal platforms) where it's usually ignored.

**Rigor over speed, mostly.** Working in pharma and cosmetics R&D means results matter. Not in an abstract "good science" way — in a "this goes into a regulatory submission" or "this product formula ships to production" way. I've developed a healthy caution about overfitting, about p-values, about claims that outrun the data. The constraints of regulated industries aren't obstacles; they're clarifying.

**Open source tools.** R, Python, Quarto, Git. I'm a strong believer in reproducible, documented workflows — partly because it's the right way to do science, partly because I've seen what happens to analyses that aren't.

The blog is for things I've worked out and want to write down — not polished tutorials necessarily, but honest field notes from applied data science work.
