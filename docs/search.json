The defaults are good. The one thing worth doing immediately is writing a .github/copilot-instructions.md file at your project root.\n\n\ncopilot-instructions.md\nThis file is the most underused feature of Copilot. It is injected into every chat prompt and shapes completions without you having to re-explain context. For a typical R + Python data science project, mine looks like this:\n# Project: Ingredient Efficacy Analysis\n\n## Context\nBiostatistics project for L'Oréal R&D.\nR (primary) + Python (secondary, ML pipeline).\n1Regulated context: results feed into regulatory submissions.\n\n## R conventions\n- tidyverse style throughout\n2- Use `air` for formatting (never `styler`)\n- Package management: `renv` — always `renv::snapshot()` after install\n3- Statistical tests: mixed models via `lme4`/`nlme`, never base `aov()` for repeated measures\n- Report with `quarto` — `.qmd` files, never `.Rmd`\n\n## Python conventions\n4- `uv` for dependency management (never `pip install` directly)\n- `ruff` for formatting and linting\n- Type hints on all function signatures\n\n## What NOT to do\n5- Never suggest `p.adjust()` without context — ask which correction is appropriate\n- Never suggest `lm()` on repeated measures data without flagging the assumption violation\n- Never install packages outside of `renv::install()` / `uv add`\n\n1\n\nRegulatory context flag — Copilot uses this to avoid suggesting cloud APIs or non-reproducible patterns that would be inappropriate in a submission context.\n\n2\n\nExplicit formatter preference — prevents suggestions to use styler, which conflicts with air.\n\n3\n\nForce the right statistical approach for repeated measures — without this, Copilot frequently proposes aov() or t.test() on paired data.\n\n4\n\nLock down Python package management — prevents pip install suggestions that would bypass uv’s lockfile.\n\n5\n\nPrevent uncontextualised multiple testing “fixes” — a critical guard for any analysis generating multiple p-values.\n\n\nThe effect is immediate. Copilot stops suggesting library(ggplot2) when you already have a tidyverse import pattern, and it stops proposing base R testing functions when your project conventions are explicit.\n\n\nInline completions\nA few patterns that work well:\n\nData wrangling skeletons. Start typing df |&gt; filter( and Copilot will often complete the condition correctly from context. Accept with Tab, verify the column name.\nTest stubs. Write the function name and a comment like # Test: returns NA for empty input, then let Copilot draft the testthat::test_that() block.\nDocstrings. Place the cursor above a function definition and type #' — Copilot completes the roxygen skeleton from the function signature.\n\n\n\nWhere Copilot earns its keep\n\nBoilerplate ggplot2 themes and axis formatting\ndplyr/tidyr pipelines for reshaping\nWriting repetitive unit tests once you’ve shown the pattern\nSQL query generation from a clear English description\n\n\n\nWhere it fails\n\nStatistical model selection. Do not ask Copilot whether to use a mixed model or a generalized estimating equations (GEE) model for your longitudinal data. It will give you a plausible-sounding answer that may be wrong for your specific design. This requires domain judgment.\nP-value interpretation. I’ve seen Copilot generate commentary like “the result is highly significant (p = 0.03)” in a context where 0.03 is borderline given the multiple testing burden. It doesn’t know your correction strategy.\nRegulatory logic. Any code that feeds into a regulatory document needs human-authored logic. Don’t let Copilot scaffold the decision rules.\n\n\nA model completing your statistical code has no understanding of your study design, missing data mechanism, or correction strategy. Plausible-looking code that chooses the wrong model or misinterprets an effect size can pass code review and still produce wrong conclusions. Statistical judgment is not delegable to autocomplete."

It can read your project structure, write new files, run commands, and execute multi-step tasks from a single prompt.\nThe key difference in practice: Copilot completes what you’re typing. OpenCode acts on what you describe.\n\nAGENTS.md\nThe same principle as copilot-instructions.md applies here, but with more scope. OpenCode reads AGENTS.md at the project root (and any subdirectory AGENTS.md files) to understand context, conventions, and constraints. A minimal but useful template:\n# AGENTS.md\n\n## Context\nR + Python data science project. Regulated context (pharma R&D).\n\n## Conventions\n- R: tidyverse, air formatter, renv for packages\n- Python: uv, ruff, type hints\n- Git: conventional commits (feat/fix/docs/refactor/test/chore)\n\n## Hard rules\n- Never install R packages without updating renv.lock\n- Never edit files in docs/ — generated output only\n- Never commit .Rhistory, .DS_Store, renv/library/\n- Statistical model selection is never delegated to AI\nThis file is worth spending 20 minutes on at project start. It will save you from correcting the same mistakes across a hundred interactions.\n\n\nWorkflow patterns that work\n\nScaffolding a new module. “Create an R script that reads a CSV, validates column types, and returns a cleaned tibble. Use our standard error handling pattern from R/utils.R.” OpenCode reads utils.R and applies the pattern.\nRefactoring. “Refactor all uses of read.csv() to readr::read_csv() across the project, and update the function signatures to use col_types explicitly.” Multi-file, handles it.\nTest generation. “Write testthat tests for every exported function in R/analysis.R. Each test should cover the happy path and one edge case.”\nDocumentation passes. “Add roxygen2 documentation to all undocumented functions in R/.”\n\n\n\nWhen Copilot is better\nOpenCode has overhead. For single-line completions, tab-completing a dplyr pipeline, or quickly looking up a function signature — Copilot is faster. Use OpenCode when the task has enough scope that describing it in prose is more efficient than typing it yourself."

    "section": "The deeper question",
    "text": "The deeper question\nThe most significant shift LLM tools have introduced is not writing speed — it’s the reading-to-writing ratio. A larger fraction of programming time is now spent reading and evaluating generated code rather than writing from scratch. This is not obviously an improvement. Writing forces you to think through the logic. Reading generated output creates a plausible-enough illusion of understanding that can be hard to distinguish from the real thing.\nThere is a cognitive load trap. When a model produces a correct-looking solution quickly, it is easy to accept it without the slower thinking that would catch a subtle statistical error or an off-by-one in a loop. The speed gain is real; the risk is that you externalize the thinking that was doing useful work.\nThe reproducibility paradox is related: you can reproduce the output (run the code again, get the same result), but you often cannot reproduce the reasoning. Why was this model chosen? Why this correction method? If the answer is “the AI suggested it,” that’s not a defensible answer in a regulated context, and it’s not a good answer in a scientific one either.\nMy honest read on where this leaves data scientists: the value of domain judgment has increased, not decreased. Anyone can now produce working boilerplate quickly. What differentiates good analytical work is the judgment about what question to ask, what method is appropriate, and what the result actually means — none of which AI tools handle well. Junior data scientists may find AI tools make them look more productive while slowing their development of that judgment. Senior practitioners benefit most, because they have the domain knowledge to catch the errors and direct the tools effectively.\nUse the tools. Read everything they produce. Keep the judgment to yourself."

The current workflow is to hold those observations in working memory and transcribe them later, or to stop the manipulation, wash hands, and type. Both routes introduce errors and cognitive load at exactly the moment when focus matters most.\nVoice removes the keyboard as a barrier. An LLM turns unstructured speech into a structured, validated record. That is the scope of this article.\nA note on the code in this article: the pipeline described here is based on architecture developed for a client project in a regulated pharma R&D context. The code snippets are deliberately simplified and generalized — they are illustrative of the design, not production implementations. They exist to communicate the structure of the solution, not to be copy-pasted into a clinical system. Domain-specific schemas, prompt libraries, and validation rules are internal to the projects they serve.\nWith that said, the architecture is real, the tooling choices are defensible, and the failure modes are drawn from actual use."

The current workflow is to hold those observations in working memory and transcribe them later, or to stop the manipulation, wash hands, and type. Both routes introduce errors and cognitive load at exactly the moment when focus matters most.\nVoice removes the keyboard as a barrier. An LLM turns unstructured speech into a structured, validated record. That is the scope of this article.\nA note on the code in this article: the pipeline described here is based on architecture developed for a client project in a regulated pharma R&D context. The code snippets are deliberately simplified and generalized — they are illustrative of the design, not production implementations. They exist to communicate the structure of the solution, not to be copy-pasted into a clinical system. Domain-specific schemas, prompt libraries, and validation rules are internal to the projects they serve.\nWith that said, the architecture is real, the tooling choices are defensible, and the failure modes are drawn from actual use."

    "text": "The problem in concrete terms\nConsider a formulation scientist working on a new topical emulsion. The experiment is a typical bench session: water phase preparation, thickener addition, pH adjustment, viscosity measurement, appearance assessment. Standard operating procedure (SOP) requires every observation to be recorded with timestamp, batch identifier, operator ID, measurement value with unit, and any deviation from expected range.\nWhat actually happens:\n\nThe scientist records observations on a paper notepad during the experiment.\nAfter the manipulation, they transcribe those notes into the ELN manually, often hours later.\nThe ELN entry requires navigating a form interface: selecting batch, selecting timepoint, entering individual fields one at a time.\nThis step takes 20–40 minutes for a typical bench session and happens at the end of the day when cognitive load is highest and recall is least reliable.\n\nThe consequences are predictable:\n\nTranscription errors: a pH of 6.8 becomes 6.9, a viscosity of 4,200 mPa·s is entered as 4,000 because the scientist no longer remembers the exact number.\nMissing fields: a deviation observed during the experiment is not recorded because it seemed minor at the time and was not written down.\nLag: observations are not timestamped to the actual moment of measurement, breaking traceability.\nInconsistent terminology: “slightly hazy”, “faintly turbid”, and “not fully clear” describe the same observation across three different entries by the same operator.\n\nNone of these are failures of discipline. They are structural consequences of asking humans to buffer observations and serialize them later under time pressure.\nThe same pattern appears across cell culture passaging (confluence estimates, viability counts, media change notes), analytical assay readouts (HPLC peak flags, integration comments), and stability study pulls (visual appearance across timepoints). The domain varies; the friction is the same."

    "text": "Stage 1 — Automatic Speech Recognition\n\nWhy Whisper, and why locally\nWhisper is OpenAI’s open-weights ASR model. The key word is open-weights: you run it on your own hardware, no audio leaves your network. In a pharma R&D context, this is not optional — it is the only defensible configuration. Audio recordings of experiments may contain compound names under NDA, formulation parameters that are trade secrets, or batch identifiers tied to regulatory submissions. Sending this audio to a cloud ASR API requires a data processing agreement, legal sign-off, and in many organizations will simply not be permitted.\nfaster-whisper is a re-implementation of Whisper using CTranslate2 that runs 2–4× faster than the original PyTorch implementation on CPU, and significantly faster on GPU. On a standard lab workstation without a GPU, faster-whisper with the medium model transcribes a 3-minute audio file in approximately 15–20 seconds. Acceptable for batch mode.\n\n\nThe pharma vocabulary problem\nWhisper is trained on general speech. It will misrecognize:\n\nCompound names: “carbomer 980” may transcribe as “carbon 980”, “hydrocarbomer” as “hydro carbomer”\nConcentration notation: “0.5% w/w” may come out as “0.5 percent double u double u”\nUnit abbreviations: “mPa·s” will not survive as-is; the scientist typically says “millipascal seconds” or “cP”\nAbbreviations: “API”, “pH”, “RPM”, “BID”, “QC”\n\nMitigation strategies:\n\nInitial prompt priming: faster-whisper accepts an initial_prompt parameter. This is injected at the start of the transcription and nudges the model toward your vocabulary. A prompt like \"Formulation lab note. Batch F-204. pH, viscosity mPa·s, carbomer, excipient, API concentration.\" meaningfully improves recognition of domain terms.\nPost-processing normalization: a lightweight text normalization step after ASR can standardize units and abbreviations before the extraction stage.\nFine-tuning: for high-volume deployments, Whisper can be fine-tuned on domain-specific audio. Out of scope for this article.\n\n\n\nNoise in the lab\nA formulation lab is not a recording studio. Overhead extractors, magnetic stirrers, water baths, and centrifuges all produce background noise. Practical guidance:\n\nUse a directional (cardioid) lapel or desktop microphone, not the built-in microphone on a laptop or phone\nWhisper’s medium and large models handle moderate noise better than tiny or base\nConsider a noise-suppression preprocessing step (e.g. noisereduce) for particularly noisy environments"

    "text": "Stage 2 — Structured extraction\n\nThe core challenge: unstructured, hedged, incomplete speech\nThis is the hardest stage. A scientist dictating during an experiment does not produce clean, form-like speech.

Viscosity is approximately 4,200 — that’s in millipascal seconds — pH is 5.9. Appearance is slightly hazy, no lumps visible. No deviations to report.”\n\nProblems the extraction layer must handle:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpeech pattern\nExample\nWhat to do\n\n\n\n\nHedged values\n“approximately 4,200”, “maybe 6.8”\nExtract the value; set a hedged flag\n\n\nInferred units\n“that’s in millipascal seconds”\nAssociate retrospectively with the preceding value\n\n\nMissing fields\nBatch ID not stated\nSet to null; trigger review flag\n\n\nConversational filler\n“Okay so”, “that’s about”\nIgnore in extraction\n\n\nMultiple measurements in one utterance\npH and viscosity in same sentence\nExtract as separate records or a multi-measurement record\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy Instructor\nInstructor is a library that wraps LLM API calls to guarantee structured output conforming to a Pydantic schema. Instead of asking the LLM to “return JSON”, which produces unreliable free-form output, Instructor uses tool-calling or structured output modes to force the model to populate every field of your schema. If the model cannot populate a field, it sets it to null rather than hallucinating a value.\nThis is the critical reliability mechanism of the pipeline. Without it, you are parsing free-form LLM JSON output with all the brittleness that entails.\n\n\nThe Pydantic schema\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel, Field\nfrom typing import Optional\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom enum import Enum\n\n\nclass AppearanceDescriptor(str, Enum):\n    CLEAR = \"clear\"\n    SLIGHTLY_HAZY = \"slightly_hazy\"\n    HAZY = \"hazy\"\n    TURBID = \"turbid\"\n    OPAQUE = \"opaque\"\n    OTHER = \"other\"\n\n\nclass LabObservation(BaseModel):\n    \"\"\"Structured record of a single lab observation extracted from voice.\"\"\"\n\n    sample_id: Optional[str] = Field(\n        None,\n        description=\"Sample identifier as stated by the operator (e.g. 'F-204')\",\n    )\n    batch_id: Optional[str] = Field(\n        None,\n        description=\"Batch identifier if distinct from sample_id\",\n    )\n    operator_id: Optional[str] = Field(\n        None,\n        description=\"Operator name or ID as stated in the recording\",\n    )\n    stated_timestamp: Optional[str] = Field(\n        None,\n        description=\"Time stated by the operator (e.g. '14:32'), as a string\",\n    )\n    measurement_type: Optional[str] = Field(\n        None,\n        description=\"Type of measurement (e.g. 'viscosity', 'pH', 'temperature')\",\n    )\n    value: Optional[float] = Field(\n        None,\n        description=\"Numeric value of the measurement\",\n    )\n    unit: Optional[str] = Field(\n        None,\n        description=\"Unit of the measurement (e.g. 'mPa·s', 'pH', '°C', 'g')\",\n    )\n    appearance: Optional[AppearanceDescriptor] = Field(\n        None,\n        description=\"Appearance descriptor if stated\",\n    )\n    ingredient_added: Optional[str] = Field(\n        None,\n        description=\"Name of any ingredient or excipient added during this observation\",\n    )\n    ingredient_quantity: Optional[float] = Field(None)\n    ingredient_unit: Optional[str] = Field(None)\n    deviation_flag: bool = Field(\n        False,\n        description=\"True if the operator reported a deviation from expected range\",\n    )\n    hedged: bool = Field(\n        False,\n        description=\"True if the value was qualified ('approximately', 'about', 'maybe')\",\n    )\n    notes: Optional[str] = Field(\n        None,\n        description=\"Any additional free-text observations not captured in structured fields\",\n    )\nThe schema uses Optional for every observation field except deviation_flag and hedged. This is deliberate: a missing field is more honest than a hallucinated one. The downstream validation stage decides what to do with null values.\nThe AppearanceDescriptor enum is a controlled vocabulary. Free-text appearance descriptions (“slightly hazy”, “not fully clear”, “faintly turbid”) are mapped to a fixed set of terms by the LLM. This solves the inconsistent terminology problem at source.\n\n\nPrompt engineering\nFew-shot examples are the most important part of the prompt. The examples must include clean inputs and realistic messy inputs — hedged values, missing fields, multi-measurement utterances.\nSYSTEM_PROMPT = \"\"\"\nYou are a laboratory data extraction assistant for a pharmaceutical formulation lab.\nYour task is to extract structured observations from a voice transcript of a scientist\nrecording bench notes.\n\nRules:\n- Extract only what is explicitly stated. Do not infer or assume field values.\n- If a value is hedged (\"approximately\", \"about\", \"maybe\", \"around\"), set hedged=true.\n- If a field is not stated, set it to null. Never invent a value.\n- Map appearance descriptions to the closest AppearanceDescriptor enum value.\n- If multiple measurements are stated in one transcript, extract only the primary one\n  and put the rest in the notes field.\n\nExamples:\n\nInput: \"Antoine here, batch F-204, pH is 5.9, no issues.\"\nOutput: {operator_id: \"Antoine\", batch_id: \"F-204\", measurement_type: \"pH\",\n         value: 5.9, unit: \"pH\", deviation_flag: false, hedged: false}\n\nInput: \"Viscosity is about 4,200 millipascal seconds, appearance is slightly hazy.\"\nOutput: {measurement_type: \"viscosity\", value: 4200.0, unit: \"mPa·s\",\n         appearance: \"slightly_hazy\", hedged: true}\n\nInput: \"Added 1.2 grams of carbomer, mixing at 500 RPM.\"\nOutput: {ingredient_added: \"carbomer\", ingredient_quantity: 1.2,\n         ingredient_unit: \"g\", notes: \"mixing at 500 RPM\"}\n\nInput: \"Batch F-205, everything looks fine.\"\nOutput: {batch_id: \"F-205\", notes: \"operator stated 'everything looks fine'\",\n         deviation_flag: false}\n\"\"\"\nNote the last example: “everything looks fine” is not a structured observation. The correct extraction is to put it in notes and extract no measurement values, rather than inventing a plausible value because one is expected.\n\n\nRunning extraction with Instructor and Ollama\nimport instructor\nfrom ollama import Client\nfrom pydantic import ValidationError\n\n\ndef extract_observation(transcript: str) -&gt; LabObservation:\n    \"\"\"\n    Extract a structured LabObservation from a raw ASR transcript.\n\n    NOTE: This is an illustrative implementation.

For this task, an 8B instruction-tuned model (Llama 3.1 8B, Mistral 7B) is sufficient — the extraction task is not reasoning-heavy, it is slot-filling against a fixed schema. Larger models add latency without proportional quality gains for this specific use case. In a regulated environment with sensitive formulation data, the model must run locally. Cloud model APIs are not an option without a data processing agreement."

    "section": "Data governance and compliance",
    "text": "Data governance and compliance\n\nThis section covers general principles relevant to pharma and biotech R&D. It is not legal or regulatory advice. Your organization’s quality assurance and legal teams must review any system that touches regulated data before deployment.\n\n\n21 CFR Part 11 and EMA Annex 11\nElectronic records in GxP environments must be trustworthy, reliable, and equivalent to paper records. The relevant requirements for this pipeline:\n\nAudit trail: every record must have a time-stamped, operator-attributed, uneditable audit trail. The AuditRecord structure above covers this. The raw transcript (or its hash) must be retained alongside the structured record — you must be able to demonstrate that the extracted values correspond to what the operator said.\nElectronic signature: the review-and-approve step is an electronic signature event. The reviewer ID and timestamp must be captured and linked to the record. This requires identity verification — a username/password at minimum, hardware token in higher-assurance contexts.\nSystem validation: the pipeline itself must be validated under your organization’s computer system validation (CSV) framework. This means documented user requirements, functional specifications, and qualification testing. The LLM component is a challenge here — see below.\n\n\n\nThe LLM model versioning problem\nThis is the hardest compliance issue in this architecture. Classical validated software produces deterministic outputs: the same input always produces the same output, forever. An LLM does not. Two consequences:\n\nExtraction behaviour changes between model versions. If you update from llama3.1:8b to llama3.2:8b, the structured output for the same transcript may differ. This breaks the assumption that records are comparable across time.\nThe same model with different temperature settings can produce different outputs for identical inputs.\n\nPractical mitigations: - Version-lock the ASR and LLM models. Pin faster-whisper to a specific checkpoint hash; pin the Ollama model to a specific version tag. Never update without going through a revalidation cycle. - Set temperature to 0 for extraction calls. This makes the LLM as deterministic as possible (not fully deterministic, but close enough for most practical purposes). - Treat model updates as change control events: document the change, run qualification tests against a golden dataset of transcripts with known expected outputs, and obtain QA sign-off before deploying the new version. - The raw transcript is the source of truth. If the extracted record is ever challenged, the raw audio and transcript are the evidence. Store both.\n\n\nGDPR and data retention\nAudio recordings may contain personal data (operator names, and in some cases patient-adjacent information in clinical manufacturing contexts). Under GDPR:\n\nDefine and document the retention period for audio files before deployment\nAudio files should be deleted on schedule; the hashed transcript in the audit record does not constitute personal data\nIf the pipeline processes any data that could be linked to a data subject (patients, trial participants), a data protection impact assessment (DPIA) is required\n\n\n\nWhy local models are the defensible choice\nCloud ASR and LLM APIs are operationally convenient but introduce a data processor relationship that requires contractual governance. For most pharma R&D environments, the path of least resistance is local: faster-whisper on a lab workstation or server, Ollama running a locally hosted model. No data leaves the network. The governance question reduces to “who has access to this server” rather than “what does the vendor’s data processing agreement permit.”"

Scientists drop audio files to a watched folder; the pipeline processes them and writes JSON output to an output folder. No web UI required for the MVP.\nA web UI (Flask, FastAPI, or a simple Shiny/Streamlit interface) adds the review queue interface and removes the need for scientists to interact with the file system directly. This is the natural next step after the pipeline core is validated."

Prompts should be written to fill the schema, not the other way around.\nKeep the raw ASR transcript alongside every structured record. It is your evidence trail. If an extracted value is ever challenged, the transcript is what you go back to.\nUse a controlled vocabulary (enums) for all categorical fields. Free-text appearance descriptions will diverge within weeks of deployment.\nSet a confidence threshold and build the review queue before going live. “We’ll add that later” means it never gets added.\nVersion-lock both the ASR model and the LLM. Treat model updates as change control events.\nTrain operators on structured dictation. A short checklist (“state batch ID, then measurement, then deviations”) dramatically reduces missing mandatory fields.\n\n\n\nDon’t\n\nDo not send audio recordings to cloud APIs without a data processing agreement and legal clearance. This applies to OpenAI Whisper API, Deepgram, AssemblyAI, and any other cloud ASR service.\nDo not auto-commit records with missing mandatory fields or implausible values. The review gate exists to catch extraction errors before they reach the ELN.\nDo not treat the structured output as authoritative over the raw transcript. The transcript is the source of truth; the JSON is a derived representation.\nDo not skip operator training. The pipeline can handle hedged and incomplete speech, but structured dictation habits reduce the volume of records requiring human review by 60–80% in practice.\nDo not update models without revalidation. A new model version is a new system. It requires qualification testing before deployment in a regulated context."

What makes it useful in practice is what wraps it:\n\nA review UI: a minimal web interface where lab supervisors see flagged records, listen to the audio, and approve or edit before commit. This is where the GxP compliance story completes.\nOperator feedback loop: when a record is frequently flagged for the same reason (operator always forgets to state the batch ID), the review system should surface this pattern so training can be adjusted.\nMulti-observation sessions: a single bench session produces many observations. Batching them into a session record, with cross-observation consistency checks (does the batch ID stay the same throughout?), is a natural extension.\nDomain fine-tuning: for high-volume deployments, fine-tuning Whisper on your specific compound vocabulary eliminates the most common ASR errors and reduces the downstream extraction burden.\n\nThe friction this solves is real and measurable. The compliance overhead of solving it properly is also real. Neither should be understated. The value is in removing the keyboard from the critical path of scientific observation — and doing it in a way that produces data you can actually defend."

VS Code handles both, plus Quarto, plus Bash, plus whatever else you need.\nThe extensions that actually matter for a data science setup:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtension\nPurpose\n\n\n\n\nREditorSupport.r\nR language support, inline output, completion\n\n\nPosit.air-vscode\nR formatter (air) — format-on-save\n\n\nms-python.python\nPython language support\n\n\ncharliermarsh.ruff\nPython formatter + linter (ruff) — format-on-save\n\n\nquarto.quarto\nQuarto rendering, preview, syntax\n\n\nmcanouil.quarto-wizard\nExtension manager for Quarto\n\n\nms-toolsai.jupyter\nJupyter kernel support\n\n\nmarimo-team.vscode-marimo\nmarimo reactive notebook support\n\n\nusernamehw.errorlens\nInline linting errors (R and Python)\n\n\n\nA minimal settings.json that wires everything together:\n{\n  \"[r]\": {\n1    \"editor.defaultFormatter\": \"Posit.air-vscode\",\n2    \"editor.formatOnSave\": true\n  },\n  \"[python]\": {\n3    \"editor.defaultFormatter\": \"charliermarsh.ruff\",\n    \"editor.formatOnSave\": true\n  },\n4  \"r.useRenvLibPath\": true,\n5  \"r.rterm.option\": [\"--no-save\", \"--no-restore-data\", \"--quiet\"],\n6  \"python.defaultInterpreterPath\": \"${workspaceFolder}/.venv/bin/python\",\n7  \"editor.rulers\": [88]\n}\n\n1\n\nUse air (Posit’s Rust-based formatter) as the default R formatter — replaces styler.\n\n2\n\nAuto-format on every save — no manual air format . needed during editing.\n\n3\n\nUse ruff as formatter for Python — one tool replaces black, isort, and flake8.\n\n4\n\nTell the R extension to use the renv project library instead of the system library.\n\n5\n\nStart R sessions without loading .RData — prevents stale objects from contaminating fresh runs.\n\n6\n\nPoint Python to the project-local .venv — ensures uv-managed packages are picked up.\n\n7\n\nDraw a vertical ruler at column 88 — the default line-length limit used by ruff.\n\n\n\n\nR: install via rig, not CRAN\nrig is the R Installation Manager. Install it once, then install and switch between R versions cleanly:\n# macOS\n1brew tap r-lib/rig && brew install rig\n\n# Linux\n2curl -L https://rig.r-lib.org/rig-linux-latest.tar.gz | sudo tar xz -C /usr/local\n\n# Install a specific R version\n3rig add 4.5\n4rig default 4.5\n\n1\n\nInstall rig via Homebrew on macOS — the one-time setup step.\n\n2\n\nLinux alternative: download and extract the binary to /usr/local with sudo.\n\n3\n\nInstall R 4.5 — rig add downloads and sets up that exact version without touching other installations.\n\n4\n\nSet R 4.5 as the default version system-wide.\n\n\nNever install R by downloading from CRAN. rig makes version switching trivial and doesn’t pollute your system.\n\n\nPython: install via uv, not the system Python\nuv manages Python versions and virtual environments. The system Python should never be touched for project work:\n# Install uv\n1curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh\n\n# Install and pin a Python version for a project\n2uv python install 3.12\n3uv python pin 3.12\n\n1\n\nOne-liner installer — writes a uv binary to ~/.cargo/bin (or ~/.local/bin). No admin rights needed.\n\n2\n\nDownload and install CPython 3.12 — managed entirely by uv, isolated from the system Python.\n\n3\n\nWrite a .python-version file pinning this project to 3.12 — respected by uv run and uv sync.\n\n\n\n\nFormatting and linting\n\nR: air — a Rust-based formatter from Posit. Fast, opinionated, and it replaces styler. Never use formatR. Configure via air.toml at project root.\nPython: ruff — formatter and linter in one. Replaces black, isort, flake8. Configure via pyproject.toml.\n\nBoth integrate with VS Code for format-on-save. This matters for reproducibility in a non-obvious way: consistent formatting means diffs are about logic, not whitespace, which makes code review and change tracking actually useful.\n\n\nNotebooks: marimo over Jupyter\nIf you write Python notebooks, marimo is worth evaluating. It’s reactive (cells re-execute when their dependencies change), stores notebooks as pure Python scripts (Git-friendly, no JSON blob), and has a better story for reproducibility than classical Jupyter. For R, Quarto documents are the right answer for anything that isn’t pure exploration."

    "text": "Regulated Environments: Reproducibility in Pharma and Good Practices (GxP)\nEverything above applies to all data science work. But if you operate in a regulated environment — pharma, medical devices, clinical research — there are additional requirements that change the calculus significantly.\n\nWhat FDA and EMA actually expect\nThe FDA’s 21 CFR Part 11 and the European Medicines Agency (EMA)’s comparable guidance don’t prescribe specific tools. What they require is an audit trail: given a result in a regulatory submission, you must be able to demonstrate exactly which code, which data, and which environment produced it — and reproduce it on demand.\nIn practice, this means:\n\nEvery analysis is traceable to a specific software version. Not “R 4.x”, but “R 4.4.2 with renv lockfile pinned to commit abc123”.\nChanges are documented. A git history is not optional; it’s part of the validation evidence.\nThe environment is validated. IQ (Installation Qualification), OQ (Operational Qualification), PQ (Performance Qualification) aren’t bureaucratic theatre — they’re the documented proof that your platform behaves as expected.\n\n\n\nsessionInfo() is necessary but not sufficient\nsessionInfo() is the minimum. It tells you what packages were loaded in the R session at the time of analysis. Include it at the end of every regulatory-grade report:\nsessionInfo()\nBut sessionInfo() alone doesn’t let you reproduce the environment. It describes it. To actually restore it, you need a lockfile.\n\n\nrenv + Docker as a practical IQ/OQ/PQ story\nThe validation stack for a Shiny platform running on Posit Connect looks like this when done right:\n\nrenv — lockfile in the repository, pinned to an exact snapshot date. renv::restore() gives any auditor the exact library used in production.\nDocker — the base image is pinned (rocker/r-ver:4.4.2, not rocker/r-ver:latest). This ensures system libraries are frozen, not just R packages.\nGitHub Actions — CI runs the test suite and renders key reports on every push. The green CI badge is part of the OQ evidence.\nPosit Connect — deployment is version-controlled. Each deployed bundle has a manifest and can be rolled back.\n\nThe IQ document answers: “Is the software correctly installed?” — covered by the Docker image build log and the renv::restore() log.\nThe OQ document answers: “Does it perform as specified?” — covered by the automated test suite.\nThe PQ document answers: “Does it perform as required in production?” — covered by UAT sign-off and monitoring dashboards.\nThis isn’t a heavy process once it’s set up. The overhead is in the documentation, not the tooling. The tooling is Git, renv, Docker, and a CI runner — none of which require purchasing a validated platform.\n\n\nThe practical minimum for regulatory R work\nIf you’re not running a full validated platform but still need to produce defensible analyses (clinical biostatistics reports, ingredient safety dossiers, etc.):\n\nGit — every script in version control, analysis tied to a commit hash\nrenv — lockfile committed alongside the code\nsessionInfo() in every report — as a footer, not optional\nQuarto with freeze: auto — computational outputs frozen and committed; the rendered report is reproducible without re-executing\n\nThis gets you to L3/L4 on the reproducibility spectrum at low overhead. It won’t satisfy IQ/OQ/PQ for a validated system, but it satisfies the traceability requirement for analytical work and will hold up to a reasonably thorough audit."

    "text": "Conclusion\nReproducibility is no longer optional — it’s table stakes for professional data science. The tooling has matured to the point where reproducible workflows are not just possible but practical.\nBut remember: reproducibility is a spectrum, not a binary. The right approach depends on your context — who needs to reproduce the work, for how long, and at what stakes.\nStart with package management (uv for Python, rv or renv for R), add language version control (rig, uv python), and when system dependencies become complex, embrace devcontainers. Layer in Snakemake for complex multi-step pipelines, and document everything with Quarto.\nThe investment in reproducibility pays dividends: faster onboarding, fewer “works on my machine” incidents, easier debugging, and the confidence that your results can be verified and trusted. Just make sure you’re investing the right amount for your actual needs."

    "text": "What I care about at work\nWorking at the interface, not the edges. The most useful position is between the domain experts (chemists, clinicians, biologists) and the data/software systems. People who sit purely on one side often build the wrong things. My agronomy background genuinely helps here — I can read a protocol, understand an experimental design, and push back when the question being asked can’t be answered with the data available. I find these cross-functional, partner roles genuinely more interesting than working in isolation.\nTooling that disappears. The best internal tools are the ones that become invisible — people just use them. A dashboard that requires a walkthrough every time is a failed tool. I spend a lot of time thinking about user experience (UX) in contexts (scientific apps, internal platforms) where it’s usually ignored.\nRigor over speed, mostly. Working in pharma and cosmetics R&D means results matter. Not in an abstract “good science” way — in a “this goes into a regulatory submission” or “this product formula ships to production” way. I’ve developed a healthy caution about overfitting, about p-values, about claims that outrun the data. The constraints of regulated industries aren’t obstacles; they’re clarifying.\nUnderstanding models, not just using them. I’m drawn to the deeper mathematical and statistical machinery underneath the tools I reach for daily. Not for its own sake, but because I’ve found that understanding why a method works — its assumptions, its failure modes, its relationship to other approaches — makes you better at the judgment calls that actually matter.\nExplainability and the limits of black boxes. In regulated R&D, a model you can’t explain is often a model you can’t use. But beyond compliance, I’m genuinely interested in interpretable machine learning (ML) and AI as a research area — not as a constraint to work around, but as a more honest representation of what we actually know.\nStaying current without being credulous. I keep a fairly active scientific watch (veille scientifique) — following the methods literature in biostatistics, computational biology, and ML engineering. I try to distinguish between tools that have earned their place and things that are interesting but not yet ready. The field moves fast enough that this requires active effort.\nOpen source tools and reproducible workflows. R, Python, Quarto, Git, Docker. Reproducibility is not just a technical preference — it’s a practical requirement in regulated science, and it’s how you avoid the slow-motion disasters that come from analyses nobody can reconstruct. I’ve seen what happens to work that wasn’t built this way."

Instructor uses the model’s tool-calling mode to force every field of the Pydantic schema to be explicitly populated. Missing fields become null rather than hallucinated values — which matters a great deal in a compliance context.\nTwo-tier validation: Pydantic enforces structural correctness (types, enums). A separate DomainValidator class enforces scientific plausibility (pH ∈ [0, 14], viscosity ranges, unit whitelists). These are kept separate intentionally: structural failures are hard blocks; domain flags are soft and route the record to human review.\nHedged values as a first-class concept: When a scientist says “approximately 4,200 millipascal seconds”, the hedged=True flag is set in the schema and the record goes to the review queue — not committed blindly. This is a deliberate design choice, not a limitation."

    "text": "The one idea everything builds on\nThe entire edifice of frequentist statistics rests on one uncomfortable idea: we can’t prove things, we can only assess how surprising our data would be if nothing was happening.\nThe formal name for “nothing is happening” is the null hypothesis, H₀. Examples:\n\nH₀: this ingredient has no effect on skin hydration\nH₀: the two manufacturing batches have the same mean viscosity\nH₀: age and disease severity are unrelated\n\nThe p-value is the probability of observing data at least as extreme as yours, assuming H₀ is true. That’s it. It is not:\n\nThe probability that your result is due to chance\nThe probability that H₀ is true\nA measure of the size or importance of an effect\nA reproducibility guarantee\n\nA worked example. You’re testing whether a new moisturiser increases skin hydration vs. a placebo. You recruit 40 volunteers (20 per group), measure hydration at baseline and after 4 weeks, compute the difference, and run a t-test. You get p = 0.032.\nWhat this means: if the ingredient truly had no effect, you’d see a difference this large or larger about 3.2% of the time by random chance alone. It’s reasonably unlikely, so you reject H₀.\nWhat this doesn’t tell you: how big the effect is, whether it’s clinically meaningful, whether you’d get the same result in a different population, or whether you’ll replicate it in the next study."

    "text": "Type I and Type II errors\nEvery statistical test makes one of four kinds of decision. The truth is binary (effect exists or not), and your conclusion is binary (significant or not). This gives a 2×2 table:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nH₀ true (no effect)\nH₀ false (effect exists)\n\n\n\n\nTest significant\nFalse positive (Type I, α)\nTrue positive (power)\n\n\nTest not significant\nTrue negative\nFalse negative (Type II, β)\n\n\n\nType I error (α): You conclude there’s an effect when there isn’t one. The false alarm. By convention, α = 0.05, meaning you accept a 5% chance of this per test.\nType II error (β): You miss a real effect. The missed detection. Power = 1 − β. A study with 80% power has a 20% chance of missing a real effect of the specified size.\nThe fire alarm analogy: α is the rate at which the alarm goes off when there’s no fire. β is the rate at which there’s a fire and the alarm doesn’t go off. You want both low. They trade off against each other for a fixed sample size.\nFrom these four cells you can derive four quantities that are far more useful than p-values in applied work:\n\nSensitivity = TP / (TP + FN) — probability the test fires when the effect is real\nSpecificity = TN / (TN + FP) — probability the test stays quiet when there’s no effect\nPPV (positive predictive value) = TP / (TP + FP) — probability the effect is real given significance\nNPV (negative predictive value) = TN / (TN + FN) — probability there’s no effect given non-significance\n\nPPV is the one people most often forget to think about. In a field where most tested hypotheses are false (say, early-stage drug screening), even a specific test produces a lot of false positives. This is part of the replication crisis."

    "section": "The regression family",
    "text": "The regression family\nTests of means and proportions cover simple comparisons. When you have multiple predictors, covariates to control for, or a continuous outcome you want to model, you need regression.\n\nLinear regression\nModels a continuous outcome as a linear function of one or more predictors. Use when: your outcome is continuous and approximately normal given the predictors. The fundamental model is lm(outcome ~ predictor1 + predictor2, data = df). Interactions between two variables are added with *: lm(outcome ~ A * B) fits main effects for A and B plus the A×B interaction.\nThe assumptions to check: residuals normally distributed (QQ-plot of residuals), constant variance (residuals vs. fitted values plot), no multicollinearity among predictors (variance inflation factor). Missing any of these doesn’t make the coefficients wrong — it makes the standard errors and p-values wrong.\n\n\nLogistic regression\nWhen your outcome is binary (success/failure, present/absent), linear regression is inappropriate — it predicts outside [0, 1] and the residuals are non-normal by construction. Logistic regression models the log-odds of the outcome. In R: glm(outcome ~ predictors, family = binomial). Coefficients are on the log-odds scale; exponentiate them (exp(coef(model))) to get odds ratios, which are more interpretable.\nThe key assumption that’s often violated: logistic regression requires approximately 10 outcome events per predictor variable. If you have 50 cases of a disease and 8 predictors, you’re on the edge. Be conservative.\n\n\nMixed models\nWhen observations are not independent — repeated measures on the same subjects, patients nested within hospitals, batches within production runs — standard regression underestimates uncertainty because it ignores the correlation structure. Mixed models (also called multilevel or hierarchical models) handle this by estimating both fixed effects (the parameters you care about) and random effects (the structure that creates correlation).\nIn R, lme4::lmer() for continuous outcomes and lme4::glmer() for binary. These models require more thought to specify correctly — but using a standard regression when you have clustered data is not a conservative choice, it’s a wrong one."

    "text": "What p-values don’t tell you\n\nEffect size\nA p-value tells you whether an effect is detectable. Effect size tells you whether it matters. With large enough n, any effect, no matter how trivially small, will be statistically significant. Standard effect size measures:\n\nCohen’s d for mean differences: d = (μ₁ − μ₂) / pooled SD. Small = 0.2, medium = 0.5, large = 0.8.\nη² (eta-squared) for ANOVA: proportion of variance explained.\nOdds ratio for logistic regression: how much more likely the outcome is per unit increase in a predictor.\n\nAlways report effect sizes alongside p-values. “Statistically significant, p = 0.03” without an effect size is an incomplete result.\n\n\nConfidence intervals\nA 95% confidence interval is a range of plausible values for the true parameter. It’s constructed so that, under repeated sampling, 95% of intervals computed this way would contain the true value. A wide confidence interval — even if it excludes zero — tells you the estimate is imprecise. In clinical or formulation work, precision matters as much as significance.\nThe confidence interval carries more information than the p-value. It tells you the direction, the magnitude, and the precision of the estimate simultaneously.\n\n\nMultiple comparisons\nEvery test you run at α = 0.05 has a 5% false positive rate. Run 20 tests and you expect one false positive just by chance. This is not a hypothetical problem — it’s routine in omics data, sensory profiling panels, and screening experiments.\nCommon corrections:\n\nBonferroni: divide α by the number of tests. Conservative but simple.\nBenjamini-Hochberg (FDR): controls the expected proportion of false positives among significant results. Less conservative, more appropriate for discovery contexts.\n\nIn R: p.adjust(p_values, method = \"BH\") for Benjamini-Hochberg.

    "text": "ROC curves\nWhen you have a continuous classifier (a model score, a biomarker value, a threshold parameter) and a binary outcome, the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve shows the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity across all possible thresholds.\nThe area under the ROC curve (AUC) summarises classifier performance in a single number. AUC = 0.5 is a random classifier. AUC = 1.0 is a perfect classifier. In practice:\n\nAUC &gt; 0.9: excellent discrimination\nAUC 0.7–0.9: acceptable\nAUC 0.5–0.7: poor\n\nIn R: pROC::roc(outcome, score) then auc(). The ROC curve is useful precisely because it’s threshold-agnostic — you can choose the operating threshold based on your acceptable trade-off between false positives and false negatives after seeing the curve, rather than committing upfront.\nOne caution: AUC is an average over all thresholds. In some applications (rare event detection, high-cost false positives), the area under the precision-recall curve is more informative."

The Dev Container specification defines a devcontainer.json file that tells VS Code (or any compatible tool) how to build or pull a container image and configure the development environment inside it.\nKey concepts:\n\ndevcontainer.json — the configuration file at .devcontainer/devcontainer.json. Specifies the image, features to install, VS Code extensions, and editor settings.\nDevcontainer features — composable installation units. Each feature is a self-contained script that installs a specific tool or set of tools into the container. Features can be published to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) or kept as local scripts.\nPre-built image vs. build-on-open — you can either reference a pre-built Docker image (\"image\": \"ghcr.io/...\") or define a Dockerfile and build the image when the devcontainer opens. Pre-built is faster and more reproducible; build-on-open is useful during development of the image itself."

But for project-specific combinations, a local feature — stored in your repository under ./features/ — is the right approach. It gives you full control without the overhead of publishing to GHCR.\nMy local feature (./features/quarto-computing-dependencies) installs the full computing stack needed for Quarto-based R + Python data science:\n\nuv — Python package manager (Astral). Installed system-wide to /usr/local/bin.\nair — R formatter CLI (Posit). The same formatter the VS Code extension uses, available in the terminal and CI.\njarl — R linter CLI. Lightweight, fast, pairs well with air.\nR packages — installed via pak, supports both Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) names and GitHub refs (user/repo@tag).\nPython packages — installed system-wide via uv pip install --system.\n\nThe feature’s devcontainer-feature.json defines its options:\n{\n  \"id\": \"quarto-computing-dependencies\",\n  \"version\": \"2.0.0\",\n  \"name\": \"Install Computing Dependencies for Quarto\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"rDeps\": {\n      \"type\": \"string\",\n      \"default\": \"rmarkdown\",\n1      \"description\": \"Comma-separated R packages to install via pak.

Passed directly to pak::pkg_install() in install.sh.\n\n2\n\npythonDeps are installed system-wide via uv pip install --system — available to all users in the container, not just a virtual environment.\n\n3\n\nTool versions default to latest — override in devcontainer.json to pin to a specific release for a reproducible build.\n\n\nAnd the installation is handled by install.sh. The R package installation step shows the pattern:\ninstall_r_deps() {\n1  local deps=$1\n  local r_vec\n2  r_vec=$(echo \"${deps}\" | sed 's/,/\",\"/g')\n3  su \"${USERNAME}\" -c \"Rscript -e 'pak::pkg_install(c(\\\"${r_vec}\\\"), upgrade = FALSE)'\"\n}\n\n1\n\ndeps receives the comma-separated string from devcontainer.json options (e.g. \"dplyr,ggplot2\").\n\n2\n\nTransforms a,b,c into \"a\",\"b\",\"c\" — the format pak::pkg_install() expects as an R character vector.\n\n3\n\nRuns as the non-root vscode user, not root — prevents R packages landing in the system library where they would conflict with renv.\n\n\nInstalling as the non-root remote user (su \"${USERNAME}\") matters here — R packages installed as root end up in a system library that can conflict with renv.\nThe composability is the main benefit of the feature pattern. You can use this same feature across different projects, passing different rDeps and pythonDeps strings without duplicating installation logic."

For a project that needs to be reproducible for audit or regulatory purposes, pin to a SHA tag:\n\"image\": \"ghcr.io/antoinelucasfra/quarto-devcontainer:sha-abc1234\"\nSHA tags are generated automatically by docker/metadata-action on every build. Find the right tag in your GHCR package page.\nTest with the devcontainer CLI. Before pushing changes to the feature or image, test locally:\nnpm install -g @devcontainers/cli\ndevcontainer build --workspace-folder .\ndevcontainer up --workspace-folder .\nThis catches errors in install.sh without triggering a full CI build.\nIterate on the feature without rebuilding the full image. If you’re modifying install.sh frequently, comment out the \"image\" line temporarily and use only the \"build\" block. This rebuilds from the base image each time, which is slower but lets you test feature changes without publishing to GHCR.\nKeep renv.lock and the devcontainer in sync. The devcontainer installs a baseline set of R packages. Project-specific packages live in renv.lock. When renv::restore() runs inside the container, it installs on top of the baseline. This separation works well — the baseline handles heavy system dependencies (like tidyverse, which takes several minutes to compile from source), while renv handles project-specific versioned packages quickly."

Machine Learning & Deep Learning\nThe ML landscape shifts constantly:\n\nTransformers everywhere: From NLP to computer vision to time series\nFoundation models: Pre-trained models as starting points\nInterpretability: Understanding what models actually learn\nMachine learning operations (MLOps): Taking models from notebooks to production\n\nResources like Hugging Face, Fast.ai, and Weights & Biases keep me connected to modern practice.\n\n\n3. Generative AI & LLMs\nThe post-2022 explosion requires active attention:\n\nModel capabilities: What can LLMs actually do reliably?\nPrompt engineering: How to get useful outputs\nIntegration patterns: Using LLMs in applications\nLimitations and risks: What they can’t do and when they fail\n\nFollowing the Hugging Face blog, research labs like DeepMind, and practitioners on social media helps filter signal from hype.\n\n\n4. Reproducibility & DevOps\nHow we build software keeps improving:\n\nPackage management: uv, renv, rv\nContainerization: Docker, devcontainers\nVersion control: Git workflows, continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD)\nDocumentation: Quarto, literate programming\n\nThe Turing Way, rOpenSci, and tool-specific documentation keep me current on best practices.\n\n\n5. Visualization & Communication\nData is only useful if you can communicate it:\n\nggplot2 ecosystem: Extensions, themes, customization\nInteractive visualizations: Plotly, htmlwidgets, Shiny\nDashboard design: Layout, UX, performance\nStorytelling: How to structure data narratives\n\nResources like Fundamentals of Data Visualization, the R Graph Gallery, and blogs from visualization practitioners help me communicate better."

The path made sense at each step, even if it doesn’t look obvious on paper.\nFor the past 5+ years I’ve been embedded in R&D and clinical teams at L’Oréal, Sanofi, Abolis (microbiome biotech), and now Chanel Parfums Beauté — building ML systems at the intersection of data and experimental science."

From texture classification and olfactory descriptor mining to training LoRA adapters on domain-specific datasets. Production-grade tools that go into daily research workflows.\n\n\nLLM pipelines & agentic systems\nEnd-to-end pipelines combining ASR, structured extraction (Instructor + Pydantic), and domain validation — turning unstructured scientific inputs into validated, auditable records. Local-first, compliance-aware architecture.\n\n\nStatistical modeling & analysis\nFrom design of experiments and mixed models to biostatistics in Good Practices (GxP) environments. I cover the full analytical chain — from raw assay data to interpretation for regulatory submissions.\n\n\nReproducible data science & MLOps\nEverything in Git, containerized, runnable in 6 months with uv sync or renv::restore(). Drift monitoring, CI/CD pipelines, and model versioning in GxP-adjacent environments. I’m opinionated about this because I’ve seen what happens when you’re not."
