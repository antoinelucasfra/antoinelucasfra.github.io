Machine Learning & Deep Learning\nThe ML landscape shifts constantly:\n\nTransformers everywhere: From NLP to computer vision to time series\nFoundation models: Pre-trained models as starting points\nInterpretability: Understanding what models actually learn\nMachine learning operations (MLOps): Taking models from notebooks to production\n\nResources like Hugging Face, Fast.ai, and Weights & Biases keep me connected to modern practice.\n\n\n3. Generative AI & LLMs\nThe post-2022 explosion requires active attention:\n\nModel capabilities: What can LLMs actually do reliably?\nPrompt engineering: How to get useful outputs\nIntegration patterns: Using LLMs in applications\nLimitations and risks: What they can’t do and when they fail\n\nFollowing the Hugging Face blog, research labs like DeepMind, and practitioners on social media helps filter signal from hype.\n\n\n4. Reproducibility & DevOps\nHow we build software keeps improving:\n\nPackage management: uv, renv, rv\nContainerization: Docker, devcontainers\nVersion control: Git workflows, continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD)\nDocumentation: Quarto, literate programming\n\nThe Turing Way, rOpenSci, and tool-specific documentation keep me current on best practices.\n\n\n5. Visualization & Communication\nData is only useful if you can communicate it:\n\nggplot2 ecosystem: Extensions, themes, customization\nInteractive visualizations: Plotly, htmlwidgets, Shiny\nDashboard design: Layout, UX, performance\nStorytelling: How to structure data narratives\n\nResources like Fundamentals of Data Visualization, the R Graph Gallery, and blogs from visualization practitioners help me communicate better."

The Dev Container specification defines a devcontainer.json file that tells VS Code (or any compatible tool) how to build or pull a container image and configure the development environment inside it.\nKey concepts:\n\ndevcontainer.json — the configuration file at .devcontainer/devcontainer.json. Specifies the image, features to install, VS Code extensions, and editor settings.\nDevcontainer features — composable installation units. Each feature is a self-contained script that installs a specific tool or set of tools into the container. Features can be published to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) or kept as local scripts.\nPre-built image vs. build-on-open — you can either reference a pre-built Docker image (\"image\": \"ghcr.io/...\") or define a Dockerfile and build the image when the devcontainer opens. Pre-built is faster and more reproducible; build-on-open is useful during development of the image itself."

But for project-specific combinations, a local feature — stored in your repository under ./features/ — is the right approach. It gives you full control without the overhead of publishing to GHCR.\nMy local feature (./features/quarto-computing-dependencies) installs the full computing stack needed for Quarto-based R + Python data science:\n\nuv — Python package manager (Astral). Installed system-wide to /usr/local/bin.\nair — R formatter CLI (Posit). The same formatter the VS Code extension uses, available in the terminal and CI.\njarl — R linter CLI. Lightweight, fast, pairs well with air.\nR packages — installed via pak, supports both Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) names and GitHub refs (user/repo@tag).\nPython packages — installed system-wide via uv pip install --system.\n\nThe feature’s devcontainer-feature.json defines its options:\n{\n  \"id\": \"quarto-computing-dependencies\",\n  \"version\": \"2.0.0\",\n  \"name\": \"Install Computing Dependencies for Quarto\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"rDeps\": {\n      \"type\": \"string\",\n      \"default\": \"rmarkdown\",\n      \"description\": \"Comma-separated R packages to install via pak. Supports CRAN names and GitHub refs.\"\n    },\n    \"pythonDeps\": {\n      \"type\": \"string\",\n      \"default\": \"jupyter,papermill,marimo\",\n      \"description\": \"Comma-separated Python packages to install via uv pip install --system.\"\n    },\n    \"uvVersion\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"default\": \"latest\" },\n    \"airVersion\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"default\": \"latest\" },\n    \"jarlVersion\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"default\": \"latest\" }\n  }\n}\nAnd the installation is handled by install.sh. The R package installation step shows the pattern:\ninstall_r_deps() {\n1  local deps=$1\n  local r_vec\n2  r_vec=$(echo \"${deps}\" | sed 's/,/\",\"/g')\n3  su \"${USERNAME}\" -c \"Rscript -e 'pak::pkg_install(c(\\\"${r_vec}\\\"), upgrade = FALSE)'\"\n}\n\n1\n\ndeps receives the comma-separated string from devcontainer.json options (e.g. \"dplyr,ggplot2\").\n\n2\n\nTransforms a,b,c into \"a\",\"b\",\"c\" — the format pak::pkg_install() expects as an R character vector.\n\n3\n\nRuns as the non-root vscode user, not root — prevents R packages landing in the system library where they would conflict with renv.\n\n\nInstalling as the non-root remote user (su \"${USERNAME}\") matters here — R packages installed as root end up in a system library that can conflict with renv.\nThe composability is the main benefit of the feature pattern. You can use this same feature across different projects, passing different rDeps and pythonDeps strings without duplicating installation logic."

R packages and uv installs respect this.\nThe quarto-cli feature installs TinyTeX (installTinyTex: \"true\") so PDF output works without any additional setup.\n\"r.useRenvLibPath\": true — tells the R VS Code extension to use the project’s renv library, so renv::restore() and the extension’s package index stay in sync.\nFormat-on-save is enabled for both R (air) and Python (ruff).

For a project that needs to be reproducible for audit or regulatory purposes, pin to a SHA tag:\n\"image\": \"ghcr.io/antoinelucasfra/quarto-devcontainer:sha-abc1234\"\nSHA tags are generated automatically by docker/metadata-action on every build. Find the right tag in your GHCR package page.\nTest with the devcontainer CLI. Before pushing changes to the feature or image, test locally:\nnpm install -g @devcontainers/cli\ndevcontainer build --workspace-folder .\ndevcontainer up --workspace-folder .\nThis catches errors in install.sh without triggering a full CI build.\nIterate on the feature without rebuilding the full image. If you’re modifying install.sh frequently, comment out the \"image\" line temporarily and use only the \"build\" block. This rebuilds from the base image each time, which is slower but lets you test feature changes without publishing to GHCR.\nKeep renv.lock and the devcontainer in sync. The devcontainer installs a baseline set of R packages. Project-specific packages live in renv.lock. When renv::restore() runs inside the container, it installs on top of the baseline. This separation works well — the baseline handles heavy system dependencies (like tidyverse, which takes several minutes to compile from source), while renv handles project-specific versioned packages quickly."

The false alarm. By convention, α = 0.05, meaning you accept a 5% chance of this per test.\nType II error (β): You miss a real effect. The missed detection. Power = 1 − β. A study with 80% power has a 20% chance of missing a real effect of the specified size.\nThe fire alarm analogy: α is the rate at which the alarm goes off when there’s no fire. β is the rate at which there’s a fire and the alarm doesn’t go off. You want both low. They trade off against each other for a fixed sample size.\nFrom these four cells you can derive four quantities that are far more useful than p-values in applied work:\n\nSensitivity = TP / (TP + FN) — probability the test fires when the effect is real\nSpecificity = TN / (TN + FP) — probability the test stays quiet when there’s no effect\nPPV (positive predictive value) = TP / (TP + FP) — probability the effect is real given significance\nNPV (negative predictive value) = TN / (TN + FN) — probability there’s no effect given non-significance\n\nPPV is the one people most often forget to think about. In a field where most tested hypotheses are false (say, early-stage drug screening), even a specific test produces a lot of false positives. This is part of the replication crisis."

    "section": "The regression family",
    "text": "The regression family\nTests of means and proportions cover simple comparisons. When you have multiple predictors, covariates to control for, or a continuous outcome you want to model, you need regression.\n\nLinear regression\nModels a continuous outcome as a linear function of one or more predictors. Use when: your outcome is continuous and approximately normal given the predictors. The fundamental model is lm(outcome ~ predictor1 + predictor2, data = df). Interactions between two variables are added with *: lm(outcome ~ A * B) fits main effects for A and B plus the A×B interaction.\nThe assumptions to check: residuals normally distributed (QQ-plot of residuals), constant variance (residuals vs. fitted values plot), no multicollinearity among predictors (variance inflation factor). Missing any of these doesn’t make the coefficients wrong — it makes the standard errors and p-values wrong.\n\n\nLogistic regression\nWhen your outcome is binary (success/failure, present/absent), linear regression is inappropriate — it predicts outside [0, 1] and the residuals are non-normal by construction. Logistic regression models the log-odds of the outcome. In R: glm(outcome ~ predictors, family = binomial). Coefficients are on the log-odds scale; exponentiate them (exp(coef(model))) to get odds ratios, which are more interpretable.\nThe key assumption that’s often violated: logistic regression requires approximately 10 outcome events per predictor variable. If you have 50 cases of a disease and 8 predictors, you’re on the edge. Be conservative.\n\n\nMixed models\nWhen observations are not independent — repeated measures on the same subjects, patients nested within hospitals, batches within production runs — standard regression underestimates uncertainty because it ignores the correlation structure. Mixed models (also called multilevel or hierarchical models) handle this by estimating both fixed effects (the parameters you care about) and random effects (the structure that creates correlation).\nIn R, lme4::lmer() for continuous outcomes and lme4::glmer() for binary. These models require more thought to specify correctly — but using a standard regression when you have clustered data is not a conservative choice, it’s a wrong one."

    "text": "What p-values don’t tell you\n\nEffect size\nA p-value tells you whether an effect is detectable. Effect size tells you whether it matters. With large enough n, any effect, no matter how trivially small, will be statistically significant. Standard effect size measures:\n\nCohen’s d for mean differences: d = (μ₁ − μ₂) / pooled SD. Small = 0.2, medium = 0.5, large = 0.8.\nη² (eta-squared) for ANOVA: proportion of variance explained.\nOdds ratio for logistic regression: how much more likely the outcome is per unit increase in a predictor.\n\nAlways report effect sizes alongside p-values. “Statistically significant, p = 0.03” without an effect size is an incomplete result.\n\n\nConfidence intervals\nA 95% confidence interval is a range of plausible values for the true parameter. It’s constructed so that, under repeated sampling, 95% of intervals computed this way would contain the true value. A wide confidence interval — even if it excludes zero — tells you the estimate is imprecise. In clinical or formulation work, precision matters as much as significance.\nThe confidence interval carries more information than the p-value. It tells you the direction, the magnitude, and the precision of the estimate simultaneously.\n\n\nMultiple comparisons\nEvery test you run at α = 0.05 has a 5% false positive rate. Run 20 tests and you expect one false positive just by chance. This is not a hypothetical problem — it’s routine in omics data, sensory profiling panels, and screening experiments.\nCommon corrections:\n\nBonferroni: divide α by the number of tests. Conservative but simple.\nBenjamini-Hochberg (FDR): controls the expected proportion of false positives among significant results. Less conservative, more appropriate for discovery contexts.\n\nIn R: p.adjust(p_values, method = \"BH\") for Benjamini-Hochberg. Use it whenever you’re reporting more than 5 or so tests simultaneously."

AUC = 0.5 is a random classifier. AUC = 1.0 is a perfect classifier. In practice:\n\nAUC &gt; 0.9: excellent discrimination\nAUC 0.7–0.9: acceptable\nAUC 0.5–0.7: poor\n\nIn R: pROC::roc(outcome, score) then auc(). The ROC curve is useful precisely because it’s threshold-agnostic — you can choose the operating threshold based on your acceptable trade-off between false positives and false negatives after seeing the curve, rather than committing upfront.\nOne caution: AUC is an average over all thresholds. In some applications (rare event detection, high-cost false positives), the area under the precision-recall curve is more informative."

    "text": "What I care about at work\nWorking at the interface, not the edges. The most useful position is between the domain experts (chemists, clinicians, biologists) and the data/software systems. People who sit purely on one side often build the wrong things. My agronomy background genuinely helps here — I can read a protocol, understand an experimental design, and push back when the question being asked can’t be answered with the data available. I find these cross-functional, partner roles genuinely more interesting than working in isolation.\nTooling that disappears. The best internal tools are the ones that become invisible — people just use them. A dashboard that requires a walkthrough every time is a failed tool. I spend a lot of time thinking about user experience (UX) in contexts (scientific apps, internal platforms) where it’s usually ignored.\nRigor over speed, mostly. Working in pharma and cosmetics R&D means results matter. Not in an abstract “good science” way — in a “this goes into a regulatory submission” or “this product formula ships to production” way. I’ve developed a healthy caution about overfitting, about p-values, about claims that outrun the data. The constraints of regulated industries aren’t obstacles; they’re clarifying.\nUnderstanding models, not just using them. I’m drawn to the deeper mathematical and statistical machinery underneath the tools I reach for daily. Not for its own sake, but because I’ve found that understanding why a method works — its assumptions, its failure modes, its relationship to other approaches — makes you better at the judgment calls that actually matter.\nExplainability and the limits of black boxes. In regulated R&D, a model you can’t explain is often a model you can’t use. But beyond compliance, I’m genuinely interested in interpretable machine learning (ML) and AI as a research area — not as a constraint to work around, but as a more honest representation of what we actually know.\nStaying current without being credulous. I keep a fairly active scientific watch (veille scientifique) — following the methods literature in biostatistics, computational biology, and ML engineering. I try to distinguish between tools that have earned their place and things that are interesting but not yet ready. The field moves fast enough that this requires active effort.\nOpen source tools and reproducible workflows. R, Python, Quarto, Git, Docker. Reproducibility is not just a technical preference — it’s a practical requirement in regulated science, and it’s how you avoid the slow-motion disasters that come from analyses nobody can reconstruct. I’ve seen what happens to work that wasn’t built this way."

    "section": "Setting Up Your Environment",
    "text": "Setting Up Your Environment\nBefore you can have a reproducible workflow, you need a consistent development environment. This matters more than most people realise — subtle differences between machines (R versions, system libraries, editor settings) cause problems that are hard to debug and impossible to prevent without a baseline setup.\n\nVS Code as your polyglot IDE\nIf you write both R and Python, VS Code is the only reasonable choice. RStudio is excellent for pure R work but does not handle Python well. PyCharm goes the other way.

Install it once, then install and switch between R versions cleanly:\n# macOS\nbrew tap r-lib/rig && brew install rig\n\n# Linux\ncurl -L https://rig.r-lib.org/rig-linux-latest.tar.gz | sudo tar xz -C /usr/local\n\n# Install a specific R version\nrig add 4.5\nrig default 4.5\nNever install R by downloading from CRAN. rig makes version switching trivial and doesn’t pollute your system.\n\n\nPython: install via uv, not the system Python\nuv manages Python versions and virtual environments. The system Python should never be touched for project work:\n# Install uv\ncurl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh\n\n# Install and pin a Python version for a project\nuv python install 3.12\nuv python pin 3.12\n\n\nFormatting and linting\n\nR: air — a Rust-based formatter from Posit. Fast, opinionated, and it replaces styler. Never use formatR. Configure via air.toml at project root.\nPython: ruff — formatter and linter in one. Replaces black, isort, flake8. Configure via pyproject.toml.\n\nBoth integrate with VS Code for format-on-save. This matters for reproducibility in a non-obvious way: consistent formatting means diffs are about logic, not whitespace, which makes code review and change tracking actually useful.\n\n\nNotebooks: marimo over Jupyter\nIf you write Python notebooks, marimo is worth evaluating. It’s reactive (cells re-execute when their dependencies change), stores notebooks as pure Python scripts (Git-friendly, no JSON blob), and has a better story for reproducibility than classical Jupyter. For R, Quarto documents are the right answer for anything that isn’t pure exploration."

    "text": "Regulated Environments: Reproducibility in Pharma and Good Practices (GxP)\nEverything above applies to all data science work. But if you operate in a regulated environment — pharma, medical devices, clinical research — there are additional requirements that change the calculus significantly.\n\nWhat FDA and EMA actually expect\nThe FDA’s 21 CFR Part 11 and the European Medicines Agency (EMA)’s comparable guidance don’t prescribe specific tools. What they require is an audit trail: given a result in a regulatory submission, you must be able to demonstrate exactly which code, which data, and which environment produced it — and reproduce it on demand.\nIn practice, this means:\n\nEvery analysis is traceable to a specific software version. Not “R 4.x”, but “R 4.4.2 with renv lockfile pinned to commit abc123”.\nChanges are documented. A git history is not optional; it’s part of the validation evidence.\nThe environment is validated. IQ (Installation Qualification), OQ (Operational Qualification), PQ (Performance Qualification) aren’t bureaucratic theatre — they’re the documented proof that your platform behaves as expected.\n\n\n\nsessionInfo() is necessary but not sufficient\nsessionInfo() is the minimum. It tells you what packages were loaded in the R session at the time of analysis. Include it at the end of every regulatory-grade report:\nsessionInfo()\nBut sessionInfo() alone doesn’t let you reproduce the environment. It describes it. To actually restore it, you need a lockfile.\n\n\nrenv + Docker as a practical IQ/OQ/PQ story\nThe validation stack for a Shiny platform running on Posit Connect looks like this when done right:\n\nrenv — lockfile in the repository, pinned to an exact snapshot date. renv::restore() gives any auditor the exact library used in production.\nDocker — the base image is pinned (rocker/r-ver:4.4.2, not rocker/r-ver:latest). This ensures system libraries are frozen, not just R packages.\nGitHub Actions — CI runs the test suite and renders key reports on every push. The green CI badge is part of the OQ evidence.\nPosit Connect — deployment is version-controlled. Each deployed bundle has a manifest and can be rolled back.\n\nThe IQ document answers: “Is the software correctly installed?” — covered by the Docker image build log and the renv::restore() log.\nThe OQ document answers: “Does it perform as specified?” — covered by the automated test suite.\nThe PQ document answers: “Does it perform as required in production?” — covered by UAT sign-off and monitoring dashboards.\nThis isn’t a heavy process once it’s set up. The overhead is in the documentation, not the tooling. The tooling is Git, renv, Docker, and a CI runner — none of which require purchasing a validated platform.\n\n\nThe practical minimum for regulatory R work\nIf you’re not running a full validated platform but still need to produce defensible analyses (clinical biostatistics reports, ingredient safety dossiers, etc.):\n\nGit — every script in version control, analysis tied to a commit hash\nrenv — lockfile committed alongside the code\nsessionInfo() in every report — as a footer, not optional\nQuarto with freeze: auto — computational outputs frozen and committed; the rendered report is reproducible without re-executing\n\nThis gets you to L3/L4 on the reproducibility spectrum at low overhead. It won’t satisfy IQ/OQ/PQ for a validated system, but it satisfies the traceability requirement for analytical work and will hold up to a reasonably thorough audit."

The tooling has matured to the point where reproducible workflows are not just possible but practical.\nBut remember: reproducibility is a spectrum, not a binary. The right approach depends on your context — who needs to reproduce the work, for how long, and at what stakes.\nStart with package management (uv for Python, rv or renv for R), add language version control (rig, uv python), and when system dependencies become complex, embrace devcontainers. Layer in Snakemake for complex multi-step pipelines, and document everything with Quarto.\nThe investment in reproducibility pays dividends: faster onboarding, fewer “works on my machine” incidents, easier debugging, and the confidence that your results can be verified and trusted. Just make sure you’re investing the right amount for your actual needs."

    "text": "GitHub Copilot\n\nSetup\nInstall two extensions in VS Code:\n\nGitHub.copilot — inline completions\nGitHub.copilot-chat — sidebar chat and inline /explain, /fix, /doc\n\nThat’s it. The defaults are good. The one thing worth doing immediately is writing a .github/copilot-instructions.md file at your project root.\n\n\ncopilot-instructions.md\nThis file is the most underused feature of Copilot. It is injected into every chat prompt and shapes completions without you having to re-explain context. For a typical R + Python data science project, mine looks like this:\n# Project: Ingredient Efficacy Analysis\n\n## Context\nBiostatistics project for L'Oréal R&D.\nR (primary) + Python (secondary, ML pipeline).\nRegulated context: results feed into regulatory submissions.\n\n## R conventions\n- tidyverse style throughout\n- Use `air` for formatting (never `styler`)\n- Package management: `renv` — always `renv::snapshot()` after install\n- Statistical tests: mixed models via `lme4`/`nlme`, never base `aov()` for repeated measures\n- Report with `quarto` — `.qmd` files, never `.Rmd`\n\n## Python conventions\n- `uv` for dependency management (never `pip install` directly)\n- `ruff` for formatting and linting\n- Type hints on all function signatures\n\n## What NOT to do\n- Never suggest `p.adjust()` without context — ask which correction is appropriate\n- Never suggest `lm()` on repeated measures data without flagging the assumption violation\n- Never install packages outside of `renv::install()` / `uv add`\nThe effect is immediate. Copilot stops suggesting library(ggplot2) when you already have a tidyverse import pattern, and it stops proposing base R testing functions when your project conventions are explicit.\n\n\nInline completions\nA few patterns that work well:\n\nData wrangling skeletons. Start typing df |&gt; filter( and Copilot will often complete the condition correctly from context. Accept with Tab, verify the column name.\nTest stubs. Write the function name and a comment like # Test: returns NA for empty input, then let Copilot draft the testthat::test_that() block.\nDocstrings. Place the cursor above a function definition and type #' — Copilot completes the roxygen skeleton from the function signature.\n\n\n\nWhere Copilot earns its keep\n\nBoilerplate ggplot2 themes and axis formatting\ndplyr/tidyr pipelines for reshaping\nWriting repetitive unit tests once you’ve shown the pattern\nSQL query generation from a clear English description\n\n\n\nWhere it fails\n\nStatistical model selection. Do not ask Copilot whether to use a mixed model or a generalized estimating equations (GEE) model for your longitudinal data. It will give you a plausible-sounding answer that may be wrong for your specific design. This requires domain judgment.\nP-value interpretation. I’ve seen Copilot generate commentary like “the result is highly significant (p = 0.03)” in a context where 0.03 is borderline given the multiple testing burden. It doesn’t know your correction strategy.\nRegulatory logic. Any code that feeds into a regulatory document needs human-authored logic. Don’t let Copilot scaffold the decision rules.\n\n\nA model completing your statistical code has no understanding of your study design, missing data mechanism, or correction strategy. Plausible-looking code that chooses the wrong model or misinterprets an effect size can pass code review and still produce wrong conclusions. Statistical judgment is not delegable to autocomplete."

    "text": "OpenCode\nOpenCode is a terminal-based agentic coding assistant. Where Copilot works at the line or block level, OpenCode operates across files and repositories. It can read your project structure, write new files, run commands, and execute multi-step tasks from a single prompt.\nThe key difference in practice: Copilot completes what you’re typing. OpenCode acts on what you describe.\n\nAGENTS.md\nThe same principle as copilot-instructions.md applies here, but with more scope. OpenCode reads AGENTS.md at the project root (and any subdirectory AGENTS.md files) to understand context, conventions, and constraints. A minimal but useful template:\n# AGENTS.md\n\n## Context\nR + Python data science project. Regulated context (pharma R&D).\n\n## Conventions\n- R: tidyverse, air formatter, renv for packages\n- Python: uv, ruff, type hints\n- Git: conventional commits (feat/fix/docs/refactor/test/chore)\n\n## Hard rules\n- Never install R packages without updating renv.lock\n- Never edit files in docs/ — generated output only\n- Never commit .Rhistory, .DS_Store, renv/library/\n- Statistical model selection is never delegated to AI\nThis file is worth spending 20 minutes on at project start. It will save you from correcting the same mistakes across a hundred interactions.\n\n\nWorkflow patterns that work\n\nScaffolding a new module. “Create an R script that reads a CSV, validates column types, and returns a cleaned tibble. Use our standard error handling pattern from R/utils.R.” OpenCode reads utils.R and applies the pattern.\nRefactoring. “Refactor all uses of read.csv() to readr::read_csv() across the project, and update the function signatures to use col_types explicitly.” Multi-file, handles it.\nTest generation. “Write testthat tests for every exported function in R/analysis.R. Each test should cover the happy path and one edge case.”\nDocumentation passes. “Add roxygen2 documentation to all undocumented functions in R/.”\n\n\n\nWhen Copilot is better\nOpenCode has overhead. For single-line completions, tab-completing a dplyr pipeline, or quickly looking up a function signature — Copilot is faster. Use OpenCode when the task has enough scope that describing it in prose is more efficient than typing it yourself."

    "section": "The deeper question",
    "text": "The deeper question\nThe most significant shift LLM tools have introduced is not writing speed — it’s the reading-to-writing ratio. A larger fraction of programming time is now spent reading and evaluating generated code rather than writing from scratch. This is not obviously an improvement. Writing forces you to think through the logic. Reading generated output creates a plausible-enough illusion of understanding that can be hard to distinguish from the real thing.\nThere is a cognitive load trap. When a model produces a correct-looking solution quickly, it is easy to accept it without the slower thinking that would catch a subtle statistical error or an off-by-one in a loop. The speed gain is real; the risk is that you externalize the thinking that was doing useful work.\nThe reproducibility paradox is related: you can reproduce the output (run the code again, get the same result), but you often cannot reproduce the reasoning. Why was this model chosen? Why this correction method? If the answer is “the AI suggested it,” that’s not a defensible answer in a regulated context, and it’s not a good answer in a scientific one either.\nMy honest read on where this leaves data scientists: the value of domain judgment has increased, not decreased. Anyone can now produce working boilerplate quickly. What differentiates good analytical work is the judgment about what question to ask, what method is appropriate, and what the result actually means — none of which AI tools handle well. Junior data scientists may find AI tools make them look more productive while slowing their development of that judgment. Senior practitioners benefit most, because they have the domain knowledge to catch the errors and direct the tools effectively.\nUse the tools. Read everything they produce. Keep the judgment to yourself."
