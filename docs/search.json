The defaults are good. The one thing worth doing immediately is writing a .github/copilot-instructions.md file at your project root.\n\n\ncopilot-instructions.md\nThis file is the most underused feature of Copilot. It is injected into every chat prompt and shapes completions without you having to re-explain context. For a typical R + Python data science project, mine looks like this:\n# Project: Ingredient Efficacy Analysis\n\n## Context\nBiostatistics project for L'Oréal R&D.\nR (primary) + Python (secondary, ML pipeline).\nRegulated context: results feed into regulatory submissions.\n\n## R conventions\n- tidyverse style throughout\n- Use `air` for formatting (never `styler`)\n- Package management: `renv` — always `renv::snapshot()` after install\n- Statistical tests: mixed models via `lme4`/`nlme`, never base `aov()` for repeated measures\n- Report with `quarto` — `.qmd` files, never `.Rmd`\n\n## Python conventions\n- `uv` for dependency management (never `pip install` directly)\n- `ruff` for formatting and linting\n- Type hints on all function signatures\n\n## What NOT to do\n- Never suggest `p.adjust()` without context — ask which correction is appropriate\n- Never suggest `lm()` on repeated measures data without flagging the assumption violation\n- Never install packages outside of `renv::install()` / `uv add`\nThe effect is immediate. Copilot stops suggesting library(ggplot2) when you already have a tidyverse import pattern, and it stops proposing base R testing functions when your project conventions are explicit.\n\n\nInline completions\nA few patterns that work well:\n\nData wrangling skeletons. Start typing df |&gt; filter( and Copilot will often complete the condition correctly from context. Accept with Tab, verify the column name.\nTest stubs. Write the function name and a comment like # Test: returns NA for empty input, then let Copilot draft the testthat::test_that() block.\nDocstrings. Place the cursor above a function definition and type #' — Copilot completes the roxygen skeleton from the function signature.\n\n\n\nWhere Copilot earns its keep\n\nBoilerplate ggplot2 themes and axis formatting\ndplyr/tidyr pipelines for reshaping\nWriting repetitive unit tests once you’ve shown the pattern\nSQL query generation from a clear English description\n\n\n\nWhere it fails\n\nStatistical model selection. Do not ask Copilot whether to use a mixed model or a GEE for your longitudinal data. It will give you a plausible-sounding answer that may be wrong for your specific design. This requires domain judgment.\nP-value interpretation. I’ve seen Copilot generate commentary like “the result is highly significant (p = 0.03)” in a context where 0.03 is borderline given the multiple testing burden. It doesn’t know your correction strategy.\nRegulatory logic. Any code that feeds into a regulatory document needs human-authored logic. Don’t let Copilot scaffold the decision rules."

It can read your project structure, write new files, run commands, and execute multi-step tasks from a single prompt.\nThe key difference in practice: Copilot completes what you’re typing. OpenCode acts on what you describe.\n\nAGENTS.md\nThe same principle as copilot-instructions.md applies here, but with more scope. OpenCode reads AGENTS.md at the project root (and any subdirectory AGENTS.md files) to understand context, conventions, and constraints. A minimal but useful template:\n# AGENTS.md\n\n## Context\nR + Python data science project. Regulated context (pharma R&D).\n\n## Conventions\n- R: tidyverse, air formatter, renv for packages\n- Python: uv, ruff, type hints\n- Git: conventional commits (feat/fix/docs/refactor/test/chore)\n\n## Hard rules\n- Never install R packages without updating renv.lock\n- Never edit files in docs/ — generated output only\n- Never commit .Rhistory, .DS_Store, renv/library/\n- Statistical model selection is never delegated to AI\nThis file is worth spending 20 minutes on at project start. It will save you from correcting the same mistakes across a hundred interactions.\n\n\nWorkflow patterns that work\n\nScaffolding a new module. “Create an R script that reads a CSV, validates column types, and returns a cleaned tibble. Use our standard error handling pattern from R/utils.R.” OpenCode reads utils.R and applies the pattern.\nRefactoring. “Refactor all uses of read.csv() to readr::read_csv() across the project, and update the function signatures to use col_types explicitly.” Multi-file, handles it.\nTest generation. “Write testthat tests for every exported function in R/analysis.R. Each test should cover the happy path and one edge case.”\nDocumentation passes. “Add roxygen2 documentation to all undocumented functions in R/.”\n\n\n\nWhen Copilot is better\nOpenCode has overhead. For single-line completions, tab-completing a dplyr pipeline, or quickly looking up a function signature — Copilot is faster. Use OpenCode when the task has enough scope that describing it in prose is more efficient than typing it yourself."

    "section": "The deeper question",
    "text": "The deeper question\nThe most significant shift LLM tools have introduced is not writing speed — it’s the reading-to-writing ratio. A larger fraction of programming time is now spent reading and evaluating generated code rather than writing from scratch. This is not obviously an improvement. Writing forces you to think through the logic. Reading generated output creates a plausible-enough illusion of understanding that can be hard to distinguish from the real thing.\nThere is a cognitive load trap. When a model produces a correct-looking solution quickly, it is easy to accept it without the slower thinking that would catch a subtle statistical error or an off-by-one in a loop. The speed gain is real; the risk is that you externalize the thinking that was doing useful work.\nThe reproducibility paradox is related: you can reproduce the output (run the code again, get the same result), but you often cannot reproduce the reasoning. Why was this model chosen? Why this correction method? If the answer is “the AI suggested it,” that’s not a defensible answer in a regulated context, and it’s not a good answer in a scientific one either.\nMy honest read on where this leaves data scientists: the value of domain judgment has increased, not decreased. Anyone can now produce working boilerplate quickly. What differentiates good analytical work is the judgment about what question to ask, what method is appropriate, and what the result actually means — none of which AI tools handle well. Junior data scientists may find AI tools make them look more productive while slowing their development of that judgment. Senior practitioners benefit most, because they have the domain knowledge to catch the errors and direct the tools effectively.\nUse the tools. Read everything they produce. Keep the judgment to yourself."

VS Code handles both, plus Quarto, plus Bash, plus whatever else you need.\nThe extensions that actually matter for a data science setup:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtension\nPurpose\n\n\n\n\nREditorSupport.r\nR language support, inline output, completion\n\n\nPosit.air-vscode\nR formatter (air) — format-on-save\n\n\nms-python.python\nPython language support\n\n\ncharliermarsh.ruff\nPython formatter + linter (ruff) — format-on-save\n\n\nquarto.quarto\nQuarto rendering, preview, syntax\n\n\nmcanouil.quarto-wizard\nExtension manager for Quarto\n\n\nms-toolsai.jupyter\nJupyter kernel support\n\n\nmarimo-team.vscode-marimo\nmarimo reactive notebook support\n\n\nusernamehw.errorlens\nInline linting errors (R and Python)\n\n\n\nA minimal settings.json that wires everything together:\n{\n  \"[r]\": {\n    \"editor.defaultFormatter\": \"Posit.air-vscode\",\n    \"editor.formatOnSave\": true\n  },\n  \"[python]\": {\n    \"editor.defaultFormatter\": \"charliermarsh.ruff\",\n    \"editor.formatOnSave\": true\n  },\n  \"r.useRenvLibPath\": true,\n  \"r.rterm.option\": [\"--no-save\", \"--no-restore-data\", \"--quiet\"],\n  \"python.defaultInterpreterPath\": \"${workspaceFolder}/.venv/bin/python\",\n  \"editor.rulers\": [88]\n}\n\n\nR: install via rig, not CRAN\nrig is the R Installation Manager. Install it once, then install and switch between R versions cleanly:\n# macOS\nbrew tap r-lib/rig && brew install rig\n\n# Linux\ncurl -L https://rig.r-lib.org/rig-linux-latest.tar.gz | sudo tar xz -C /usr/local\n\n# Install a specific R version\nrig add 4.5\nrig default 4.5\nNever install R by downloading from CRAN. rig makes version switching trivial and doesn’t pollute your system.\n\n\nPython: install via uv, not the system Python\nuv manages Python versions and virtual environments. The system Python should never be touched for project work:\n# Install uv\ncurl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh\n\n# Install and pin a Python version for a project\nuv python install 3.12\nuv python pin 3.12\n\n\nFormatting and linting\n\nR: air — a Rust-based formatter from Posit. Fast, opinionated, and it replaces styler. Never use formatR. Configure via air.toml at project root.\nPython: ruff — formatter and linter in one. Replaces black, isort, flake8. Configure via pyproject.toml.\n\nBoth integrate with VS Code for format-on-save. This matters for reproducibility in a non-obvious way: consistent formatting means diffs are about logic, not whitespace, which makes code review and change tracking actually useful.\n\n\nNotebooks: marimo over Jupyter\nIf you write Python notebooks, marimo is worth evaluating. It’s reactive (cells re-execute when their dependencies change), stores notebooks as pure Python scripts (Git-friendly, no JSON blob), and has a better story for reproducibility than classical Jupyter. For R, Quarto documents are the right answer for anything that isn’t pure exploration."

    "text": "Regulated Environments: Reproducibility in Pharma and GxP\nEverything above applies to all data science work. But if you operate in a regulated environment — pharma, medical devices, clinical research — there are additional requirements that change the calculus significantly.\n\nWhat FDA and EMA actually expect\nThe FDA’s 21 CFR Part 11 and EMA’s comparable guidance don’t prescribe specific tools. What they require is an audit trail: given a result in a regulatory submission, you must be able to demonstrate exactly which code, which data, and which environment produced it — and reproduce it on demand.\nIn practice, this means:\n\nEvery analysis is traceable to a specific software version. Not “R 4.x”, but “R 4.4.2 with renv lockfile pinned to commit abc123”.\nChanges are documented. A git history is not optional; it’s part of the validation evidence.\nThe environment is validated. IQ (Installation Qualification), OQ (Operational Qualification), PQ (Performance Qualification) aren’t bureaucratic theatre — they’re the documented proof that your platform behaves as expected.\n\n\n\nsessionInfo() is necessary but not sufficient\nsessionInfo() is the minimum. It tells you what packages were loaded in the R session at the time of analysis. Include it at the end of every regulatory-grade report:\nsessionInfo()\nBut sessionInfo() alone doesn’t let you reproduce the environment. It describes it. To actually restore it, you need a lockfile.\n\n\nrenv + Docker as a practical IQ/OQ/PQ story\nThe validation stack for a Shiny platform running on Posit Connect looks like this when done right:\n\nrenv — lockfile in the repository, pinned to an exact snapshot date. renv::restore() gives any auditor the exact library used in production.\nDocker — the base image is pinned (rocker/r-ver:4.4.2, not rocker/r-ver:latest). This ensures system libraries are frozen, not just R packages.\nGitHub Actions — CI runs the test suite and renders key reports on every push. The green CI badge is part of the OQ evidence.\nPosit Connect — deployment is version-controlled. Each deployed bundle has a manifest and can be rolled back.\n\nThe IQ document answers: “Is the software correctly installed?” — covered by the Docker image build log and the renv::restore() log.\nThe OQ document answers: “Does it perform as specified?” — covered by the automated test suite.\nThe PQ document answers: “Does it perform as required in production?” — covered by UAT sign-off and monitoring dashboards.\nThis isn’t a heavy process once it’s set up. The overhead is in the documentation, not the tooling. The tooling is Git, renv, Docker, and a CI runner — none of which require purchasing a validated platform.\n\n\nThe practical minimum for regulatory R work\nIf you’re not running a full validated platform but still need to produce defensible analyses (clinical biostatistics reports, ingredient safety dossiers, etc.):\n\nGit — every script in version control, analysis tied to a commit hash\nrenv — lockfile committed alongside the code\nsessionInfo() in every report — as a footer, not optional\nQuarto with freeze: auto — computational outputs frozen and committed; the rendered report is reproducible without re-executing\n\nThis gets you to L3/L4 on the reproducibility spectrum at low overhead. It won’t satisfy IQ/OQ/PQ for a validated system, but it satisfies the traceability requirement for analytical work and will hold up to a reasonably thorough audit."

The tooling has matured to the point where reproducible workflows are not just possible but practical.\nBut remember: reproducibility is a spectrum, not a binary. The right approach depends on your context — who needs to reproduce the work, for how long, and at what stakes.\nStart with package management (uv for Python, rv or renv for R), add language version control (rig, uv python), and when system dependencies become complex, embrace devcontainers. Layer in workflow tools like targets or Snakemake for complex pipelines, and document everything with Quarto.\nThe investment in reproducibility pays dividends: faster onboarding, fewer “works on my machine” incidents, easier debugging, and the confidence that your results can be verified and trusted. Just make sure you’re investing the right amount for your actual needs."

    "text": "I didn’t start out planning to become a data scientist. I studied agronomy engineering at Institut Agro - Agrocampus Ouest (Rennes) — which is fundamentally about applying science to complex living systems — and during my statistics courses I realized that the analytical side was what excited me most. Not just running models, but understanding why a method works, and what it can and can’t tell you about the real world.\nAfter finishing both my engineering degree and a master’s in applied mathematics and statistics in 2021, I joined Astek / IT&M Stats, a consultancy that places statisticians and data scientists inside large R&D organizations. That structure has shaped how I work: every 12–18 months, a new domain, a new team, a new set of constraints. It forces you to get good at context-switching, at earning trust quickly, and at building things that work without you being there to explain them.\nMy first mission was at L’Oréal R&D — two years of clinical biostatistics on ingredient efficacy and molecular safety studies. I covered hundreds of analyses, learned what a 2-week turnaround really means under pressure, and built internal tooling that helped the team move faster. It was a good introduction to regulated science: the kind of work where you can’t hand-wave uncertainty.\nThen Sanofi R&D, where I shifted from pure analysis to building. I designed and shipped a full R Shiny platform for managing pilot manufacturing chains across 100+ clinical projects — took on the Scrum Master role alongside the development work. That was the project that taught me that useful software is harder to build than correct software.\nAfter Sanofi, a stint at Abolis, a microbiome biotech startup. Six months, full autonomy, multi-omics data pipelines, no hand-holding. Very different energy from a pharma company, and I learned a lot from it.\nNow I’m at Chanel Parfums Beauté R&D, working on machine learning and computer vision for fragrance and cosmetics development. Still on mission via Astek/IT&M Stats, but this is the most technically ambitious role so far — models that go into production, tools that scientists depend on daily."

    "text": "What I care about at work\nWorking at the interface, not the edges. The most useful position is between the domain experts (chemists, clinicians, biologists) and the data/software systems. People who sit purely on one side often build the wrong things. My agronomy background genuinely helps here — I can read a protocol, understand an experimental design, and push back when the question being asked can’t be answered with the data available. I find these cross-functional, partner roles genuinely more interesting than working in isolation.\nTooling that disappears. The best internal tools are the ones that become invisible — people just use them. A dashboard that requires a walkthrough every time is a failed tool. I spend a lot of time thinking about UX in contexts (scientific apps, internal platforms) where it’s usually ignored.\nRigor over speed, mostly. Working in pharma and cosmetics R&D means results matter. Not in an abstract “good science” way — in a “this goes into a regulatory submission” or “this product formula ships to production” way. I’ve developed a healthy caution about overfitting, about p-values, about claims that outrun the data. The constraints of regulated industries aren’t obstacles; they’re clarifying.\nUnderstanding models, not just using them. I’m drawn to the deeper mathematical and statistical machinery underneath the tools I reach for daily. Not for its own sake, but because I’ve found that understanding why a method works — its assumptions, its failure modes, its relationship to other approaches — makes you better at the judgment calls that actually matter.\nExplainability and the limits of black boxes. In regulated R&D, a model you can’t explain is often a model you can’t use. But beyond compliance, I’m genuinely interested in interpretable ML and AI as a research area — not as a constraint to work around, but as a more honest representation of what we actually know.\nStaying current without being credulous. I keep a fairly active scientific watch (veille scientifique) — following the methods literature in biostatistics, computational biology, and ML engineering. I try to distinguish between tools that have earned their place and things that are interesting but not yet ready. The field moves fast enough that this requires active effort.\nOpen source tools and reproducible workflows. R, Python, Quarto, Git, Docker. Reproducibility is not just a technical preference — it’s a practical requirement in regulated science, and it’s how you avoid the slow-motion disasters that come from analyses nobody can reconstruct. I’ve seen what happens to work that wasn’t built this way."

Examples:\n\nH₀: this ingredient has no effect on skin hydration\nH₀: the two manufacturing batches have the same mean viscosity\nH₀: age and disease severity are unrelated\n\nThe p-value is the probability of observing data at least as extreme as yours, assuming H₀ is true.

It is not:\n\nThe probability that your result is due to chance\nThe probability that H₀ is true\nA measure of the size or importance of an effect\nA reproducibility guarantee\n\nA worked example. You’re testing whether a new moisturiser increases skin hydration vs. a placebo. You recruit 40 volunteers (20 per group), measure hydration at baseline and after 4 weeks, compute the difference, and run a t-test. You get p = 0.032.\nWhat this means: if the ingredient truly had no effect, you’d see a difference this large or larger about 3.2% of the time by random chance alone. It’s reasonably unlikely, so you reject H₀.\nWhat this doesn’t tell you: how big the effect is, whether it’s clinically meaningful, whether you’d get the same result in a different population, or whether you’ll replicate it in the next study."

The false alarm. By convention, α = 0.05, meaning you accept a 5% chance of this per test.\nType II error (β): You miss a real effect. The missed detection. Power = 1 − β. A study with 80% power has a 20% chance of missing a real effect of the specified size.\nThe fire alarm analogy: α is the rate at which the alarm goes off when there’s no fire. β is the rate at which there’s a fire and the alarm doesn’t go off. You want both low. They trade off against each other for a fixed sample size.\nFrom these four cells you can derive four quantities that are far more useful than p-values in applied work:\n\nSensitivity = TP / (TP + FN) — probability the test fires when the effect is real\nSpecificity = TN / (TN + FP) — probability the test stays quiet when there’s no effect\nPPV (positive predictive value) = TP / (TP + FP) — probability the effect is real given significance\nNPV (negative predictive value) = TN / (TN + FN) — probability there’s no effect given non-significance\n\nPPV is the one people most often forget to think about. In a field where most tested hypotheses are false (say, early-stage drug screening), even a specific test produces a lot of false positives. This is part of the replication crisis."

    "text": "The regression family\nTests of means and proportions cover simple comparisons. When you have multiple predictors, covariates to control for, or a continuous outcome you want to model, you need regression.\n\nLinear regression\nModels a continuous outcome as a linear function of one or more predictors. Use when: your outcome is continuous and approximately normal given the predictors. The fundamental model is lm(outcome ~ predictor1 + predictor2, data = df). Interactions between two variables are added with *: lm(outcome ~ A * B) fits main effects for A and B plus the A×B interaction.\nThe assumptions to check: residuals normally distributed (QQ-plot of residuals), constant variance (residuals vs. fitted values plot), no multicollinearity among predictors (variance inflation factor). Missing any of these doesn’t make the coefficients wrong — it makes the standard errors and p-values wrong.\n\n\nLogistic regression\nWhen your outcome is binary (success/failure, present/absent), linear regression is inappropriate — it predicts outside [0, 1] and the residuals are non-normal by construction. Logistic regression models the log-odds of the outcome. In R: glm(outcome ~ predictors, family = binomial). Coefficients are on the log-odds scale; exponentiate them (exp(coef(model))) to get odds ratios, which are more interpretable.\nThe key assumption that’s often violated: logistic regression requires approximately 10 outcome events per predictor variable. If you have 50 cases of a disease and 8 predictors, you’re on the edge. Be conservative.\n\n\nMixed models\nWhen observations are not independent — repeated measures on the same subjects, patients nested within hospitals, batches within production runs — standard regression underestimates uncertainty because it ignores the correlation structure. Mixed models (also called multilevel or hierarchical models) handle this by estimating both fixed effects (the parameters you care about) and random effects (the structure that creates correlation).\nIn R, lme4::lmer() for continuous outcomes and lme4::glmer() for binary. These models require more thought to specify correctly — but using a standard regression when you have clustered data is not a conservative choice, it’s a wrong one."

With large enough n, any effect, no matter how trivially small, will be statistically significant. Standard effect size measures:\n\nCohen’s d for mean differences: d = (μ₁ − μ₂) / pooled SD. Small = 0.2, medium = 0.5, large = 0.8.\nη² (eta-squared) for ANOVA: proportion of variance explained.\nOdds ratio for logistic regression: how much more likely the outcome is per unit increase in a predictor.\n\nAlways report effect sizes alongside p-values. “Statistically significant, p = 0.03” without an effect size is an incomplete result.\n\n\nConfidence intervals\nA 95% confidence interval is a range of plausible values for the true parameter. It’s constructed so that, under repeated sampling, 95% of intervals computed this way would contain the true value. A wide confidence interval — even if it excludes zero — tells you the estimate is imprecise. In clinical or formulation work, precision matters as much as significance.\nThe confidence interval carries more information than the p-value. It tells you the direction, the magnitude, and the precision of the estimate simultaneously.\n\n\nMultiple comparisons\nEvery test you run at α = 0.05 has a 5% false positive rate. Run 20 tests and you expect one false positive just by chance. This is not a hypothetical problem — it’s routine in omics data, sensory profiling panels, and screening experiments.\nCommon corrections:\n\nBonferroni: divide α by the number of tests. Conservative but simple.\nBenjamini-Hochberg (FDR): controls the expected proportion of false positives among significant results. Less conservative, more appropriate for discovery contexts.\n\nIn R: p.adjust(p_values, method = \"BH\") for Benjamini-Hochberg.

AUC = 0.5 is a random classifier. AUC = 1.0 is a perfect classifier.

Installed system-wide to /usr/local/bin.\nair — R formatter CLI (Posit). The same formatter the VS Code extension uses, available in the terminal and CI.\njarl — R linter CLI. Lightweight, fast, pairs well with air.\nR packages — installed via pak, supports both CRAN names and GitHub refs (user/repo@tag).\nPython packages — installed system-wide via uv pip install --system.\n\nThe feature’s devcontainer-feature.json defines its options:\n{\n  \"id\": \"quarto-computing-dependencies\",\n  \"version\": \"2.0.0\",\n  \"name\": \"Install Computing Dependencies for Quarto\",\n  \"options\": {\n    \"rDeps\": {\n      \"type\": \"string\",\n      \"default\": \"rmarkdown\",\n      \"description\": \"Comma-separated R packages to install via pak.

    "text": "CI/CD for the image\nThe build-push.yml workflow deserves a closer look, because this is where the reproducibility guarantee is maintained over time.\nThe workflow triggers on any change to .devcontainer/** — meaning whenever you update devcontainer.json, the Dockerfile, or the local feature scripts, a new image is built and pushed. Team members get the updated environment on their next container rebuild.\nThe multi-platform build (linux/amd64,linux/arm64) handles the growing heterogeneity of developer hardware. If you skip this, Apple Silicon users either get emulation (slow) or a different image (not reproducible). Buildx with docker/build-push-action@v6 handles cross-compilation transparently.\nGHA layer caching (type=gha) is essential for iteration speed. The base image layers are cached; only the changed layers rebuild. A change to install.sh that only modifies the R package list typically rebuilds in under 3 minutes rather than 15."

    "section": "Practical tips",
    "text": "Practical tips\nPin image tags in production. The devcontainer.json above uses latest. This is convenient for development — you always get the newest image. For a project that needs to be reproducible for audit or regulatory purposes, pin to a SHA tag:\n\"image\": \"ghcr.io/antoinelucasfra/quarto-devcontainer:sha-abc1234\"\nSHA tags are generated automatically by docker/metadata-action on every build. Find the right tag in your GHCR package page.\nTest with the devcontainer CLI. Before pushing changes to the feature or image, test locally:\nnpm install -g @devcontainers/cli\ndevcontainer build --workspace-folder .\ndevcontainer up --workspace-folder .\nThis catches errors in install.sh without triggering a full CI build.\nIterate on the feature without rebuilding the full image. If you’re modifying install.sh frequently, comment out the \"image\" line temporarily and use only the \"build\" block. This rebuilds from the base image each time, which is slower but lets you test feature changes without publishing to GHCR.\nKeep renv.lock and the devcontainer in sync. The devcontainer installs a baseline set of R packages. Project-specific packages live in renv.lock. When renv::restore() runs inside the container, it installs on top of the baseline. This separation works well — the baseline handles heavy system dependencies (like tidyverse, which takes several minutes to compile from source), while renv handles project-specific versioned packages quickly."

Manage R Versions with rig\n# Install rig (macOS)\nbrew tap r-lib/rig\nbrew install rig\n\n# Or Linux\ncurl -L https://rig.r-lib.org/rig-linux-latest.tar.gz | sudo tar xz -C /usr/local\n\n# List available R versions\nrig available\n\n# Install a specific version\nrig add 4.5\n\n# Set default version\nrig default 4.5\n\n# List installed versions\nrig list\n\n\n2. Manage Packages with rv\n# Initialize project with current R version\nrv init my-analysis\n\n# rv automatically detects R version from rig\ncat rproject.toml\n# [project]\n# r_version = \"4.5\"\n# ...\n\n\n3. The Complete Workflow\n# 1. Ensure you have the right R version\nrig add 4.5\nrig default 4.5\n\n# 2. Create a new project\nrv init data-analysis\ncd data-analysis\n\n# 3. Add your dependencies\nrv add tidyverse arrow DBI\n\n# 4. Start working\nR\n# &gt; library(tidyverse)  # Just works!\n\n\nProject-Specific R Versions\nThe r_version field in rproject.toml ensures teammates use the correct R version:\n[project]\nname = \"critical-analysis\"\nr_version = \"4.4\"  # Pin to R 4.4.x\nWith rig, switching is trivial:\nrig switch 4.4\nrv sync"

    "text": "Why This Matters for Reproducibility\nHaving worked in pharma, I know how critical reproducibility is — it’s not just nice to have, it’s a regulatory requirement. The combination of declarative package management (rv) and explicit R version management (rig) solves the two problems I’ve spent countless hours debugging:\n\n“Works on my machine” → Lockfile captures exact package versions and sources\n“Which R version?” → r_version in config + rig for installation\n\nFor regulated environments (pharma, finance, etc.), this is transformative:\n# Clone a project\ngit clone https://github.com/org/clinical-analysis\ncd clinical-analysis\n\n# Set up exact R version\nrig add $(grep r_version rproject.toml | cut -d'\"' -f2)\n\n# Restore exact package environment\nrv sync\n\n# ✅ Identical environment, guaranteed"

    "text": "Conclusion\nI’m genuinely excited about rv. It represents a paradigm shift in R package management — from iterative, reactive tooling to declarative, proactive workflows. Combined with rig for R version management, it finally gives us a modern development experience on par with what Python developers have enjoyed with uv and pyenv.\nThe R ecosystem is evolving, and I’m here for it. Tools like rv, rig, and air (the new R formatter) are bringing modern development practices to R. If you value reproducibility, speed, and developer experience like I do, give rv a try. I think you’ll be as impressed as I was."
