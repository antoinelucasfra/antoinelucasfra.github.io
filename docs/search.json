    "text": "The Domains That Matter\nLooking at my catalog, some patterns emerge. These are the domains where staying current has the highest return on investment:\n\n1. Statistical Methodology\nStatistics isn’t static. Recent years have seen significant advances in:\n\nCausal inference: Moving beyond correlation to actual causal claims\nBayesian workflows: Stan, brms, and probabilistic programming\nMixed models: Proper handling of hierarchical/longitudinal data\nEffect estimation: Beyond p-values to effect sizes and uncertainty\n\nResources like Statistical Rethinking, the R-Causal community, and blogs from Andrew Gelman help me stay grounded in what statistical practice should look like.\n\n\n2. Machine Learning & Deep Learning\nThe ML landscape shifts constantly:\n\nTransformers everywhere: From NLP to computer vision to time series\nFoundation models: Pre-trained models as starting points\nInterpretability: Understanding what models actually learn\nMLOps: Taking models from notebooks to production\n\nResources like Hugging Face, Fast.ai, and Weights & Biases keep me connected to modern practice.\n\n\n3. Generative AI & LLMs\nThe post-2022 explosion requires active attention:\n\nModel capabilities: What can LLMs actually do reliably?\nPrompt engineering: How to get useful outputs\nIntegration patterns: Using LLMs in applications\nLimitations and risks: What they can’t do and when they fail\n\nFollowing the Hugging Face blog, research labs like DeepMind, and practitioners on social media helps filter signal from hype.\n\n\n4. Reproducibility & DevOps\nHow we build software keeps improving:\n\nPackage management: uv, renv, rv\nContainerization: Docker, devcontainers\nVersion control: Git workflows, CI/CD\nDocumentation: Quarto, literate programming\n\nThe Turing Way, rOpenSci, and tool-specific documentation keep me current on best practices.\n\n\n5. Visualization & Communication\nData is only useful if you can communicate it:\n\nggplot2 ecosystem: Extensions, themes, customization\nInteractive visualizations: Plotly, htmlwidgets, Shiny\nDashboard design: Layout, UX, performance\nStorytelling: How to structure data narratives\n\nResources like Fundamentals of Data Visualization, the R Graph Gallery, and blogs from visualization practitioners help me communicate better."

Categorize\nTagging forces me to think: What domain is this? What language? What problem does it solve? This metacognition helps retention.\n\n\n3. Review\nPeriodically, I browse the catalog by category. This surfaces forgotten resources and helps me notice patterns (e.g., “I’ve saved a lot about Bayesian methods lately — maybe I should actually learn brms properly”).\n\n\n4. Apply\nThe ultimate test: when facing a problem, can I find a relevant resource quickly? If yes, the system works. If not, I need to improve my categorization or add missing resources.\n\n\n5.

The tooling has matured to the point where reproducible workflows are not just possible but practical.\nBut remember: reproducibility is a spectrum, not a binary. The right approach depends on your context — who needs to reproduce the work, for how long, and at what stakes.\nStart with package management (uv for Python, rv or renv for R), add language version control (rig, uv python), and when system dependencies become complex, embrace devcontainers. Layer in workflow tools like targets or Snakemake for complex pipelines, and document everything with Quarto.\nThe investment in reproducibility pays dividends: faster onboarding, fewer “works on my machine” incidents, easier debugging, and the confidence that your results can be verified and trusted. Just make sure you’re investing the right amount for your actual needs."

    "text": "Why This Matters for Data Scientists\nAt first glance, live coding music might seem distant from data science. But look closer, and you’ll find striking parallels:\n\n1. Patterns as Data Structures\nIn Strudel, a musical pattern is essentially a time-indexed data structure. Just as we might think about time series data, live coders think about events distributed across cyclical time. The manipulation of these patterns—filtering, transforming, combining—mirrors the operations we perform on datasets.\n\n\n2. Algorithmic Composition as Generative Modeling\nWhen a live coder writes:\nn(\"&lt;0!3 1*2&gt;\").set(chords).mode(\"root:g2\")\n  .voicing().s(\"gm_acoustic_bass\")\nThey’re essentially defining a generative model—rules that produce infinite variations within constraints. This is the same thinking behind procedural generation, Monte Carlo simulations, and generative AI.\n\n\n3. Real-Time Feedback Loops\nLive coding is the ultimate REPL experience. You modify code, hear the result immediately, adjust. This tight feedback loop is exactly what makes exploratory data analysis so powerful—and so satisfying."

Where the “DJ” is both human and algorithm, making decisions together. Where the boundary between instrument and player, between creation and curation, becomes wonderfully blurred.\nThis is not science fiction. Tools like Strudel make it possible today. The question is: what will you create?"

    "text": "I didn’t start out planning to become a data scientist. I studied agronomy engineering at AgroParisTech — which is fundamentally about applying science to complex living systems — and during my statistics courses I realized that the analytical side was what excited me most. Not just running models, but understanding why a method works, and what it can and can’t tell you about the real world.\nAfter finishing both my engineering degree and a master’s in applied mathematics and statistics in 2021, I joined Astek / IT&M Stats, a consultancy that places statisticians and data scientists inside large R&D organizations. That structure has shaped how I work: every 12–18 months, a new domain, a new team, a new set of constraints. It forces you to get good at context-switching, at earning trust quickly, and at building things that work without you being there to explain them.\nMy first mission was at L’Oréal R&D — two years of clinical biostatistics on ingredient efficacy and molecular safety studies. I covered hundreds of analyses, learned what a 2-week turnaround really means under pressure, and built internal tooling that helped the team move faster. It was a good introduction to regulated science: the kind of work where you can’t hand-wave uncertainty.\nThen Sanofi R&D, where I shifted from pure analysis to building. I designed and shipped a full R Shiny platform for managing pilot manufacturing chains across 100+ clinical projects — took on the Scrum Master role alongside the development work. That was the project that taught me that useful software is harder to build than correct software.\nAfter Sanofi, a stint at Abolis, a microbiome biotech startup. Six months, full autonomy, multi-omics data pipelines, no hand-holding. Very different energy from a pharma company, and I learned a lot from it.\nNow I’m at Chanel Parfums Beauté R&D, working on machine learning and computer vision for fragrance and cosmetics development. Still on mission via Astek/IT&M Stats, but this is the most technically ambitious role so far — models that go into production, tools that scientists depend on daily."

    "text": "What I care about at work\nWorking at the interface, not the edges. The most useful position is between the domain experts (chemists, clinicians, biologists) and the data/software systems. People who sit purely on one side often build the wrong things. My agronomy background genuinely helps here — I can read a protocol, understand an experimental design, and push back when the question being asked can’t be answered with the data available.\nTooling that disappears. The best internal tools are the ones that become invisible — people just use them. A dashboard that requires a walkthrough every time is a failed tool. I spend a lot of time thinking about UX in contexts (scientific apps, internal platforms) where it’s usually ignored.\nRigor over speed, mostly. Working in pharma and cosmetics R&D means results matter. Not in an abstract “good science” way — in a “this goes into a regulatory submission” or “this product formula ships to production” way. I’ve developed a healthy caution about overfitting, about p-values, about claims that outrun the data. The constraints of regulated industries aren’t obstacles; they’re clarifying.\nOpen source tools. R, Python, Quarto, Git. I’m a strong believer in reproducible, documented workflows — partly because it’s the right way to do science, partly because I’ve seen what happens to analyses that aren’t."

    "text": "Why This Matters for Reproducibility\nHaving worked in pharma, I know how critical reproducibility is — it’s not just nice to have, it’s a regulatory requirement. The combination of declarative package management (rv) and explicit R version management (rig) solves the two problems I’ve spent countless hours debugging:\n\n“Works on my machine” → Lockfile captures exact package versions and sources\n“Which R version?” → r_version in config + rig for installation\n\nFor regulated environments (pharma, finance, etc.), this is transformative:\n# Clone a project\ngit clone https://github.com/org/clinical-analysis\ncd clinical-analysis\n\n# Set up exact R version\nrig add $(grep r_version rproject.toml | cut -d'\"' -f2)\n\n# Restore exact package environment\nrv sync\n\n# ✅ Identical environment, guaranteed"

    "text": "Conclusion\nI’m genuinely excited about rv. It represents a paradigm shift in R package management — from iterative, reactive tooling to declarative, proactive workflows. Combined with rig for R version management, it finally gives us a modern development experience on par with what Python developers have enjoyed with uv and pyenv.\nThe R ecosystem is evolving, and I’m here for it. Tools like rv, rig, and air (the new R formatter) are bringing modern development practices to R. If you value reproducibility, speed, and developer experience like I do, give rv a try. I think you’ll be as impressed as I was."
