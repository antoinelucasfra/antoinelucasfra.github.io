<section id="why-this-matters" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="why-this-matters">Why this matters</h2>
<p>A few years ago I reviewed an internal report where an ingredient had been declared “effective” based on a p-value of 0.048 from a one-sample t-test on n=6 measurements. The analyst had run the right test, got a significant result, and written a conclusion. The problem: the study was powered to detect an effect three times larger than the one they claimed to have found, the variance was enormous, and the confidence interval ran from “meaningless effect” to “implausibly large effect”.</p>
<p>The statistical test had been applied correctly. The statistical reasoning had failed entirely.</p>
<p>This post is for the scientists, engineers, and product people who run statistical tests, interpret the results, and make decisions based on them — but who didn’t train as statisticians. The goal isn’t to make you a statistician. It’s to give you enough understanding to avoid the category of mistake above, to ask better questions, and to know when to call someone who does this professionally.</p>

</section>
<section id="the-one-idea-everything-builds-on" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-one-idea-everything-builds-on">The one idea everything builds on</h2>
<p>The entire edifice of frequentist statistics rests on one uncomfortable idea: <strong>we can’t prove things, we can only assess how surprising our data would be if nothing was happening.</strong></p>
<p>The formal name for “nothing is happening” is the null hypothesis, H₀. Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>H₀: this ingredient has no effect on skin hydration</li>
<li>H₀: the two manufacturing batches have the same mean viscosity</li>
<li>H₀: age and disease severity are unrelated</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>p-value</strong> is the probability of observing data at least as extreme as yours, <em>assuming H₀ is true</em>. That’s it. It is not:</p>
<ul>
<li>The probability that your result is due to chance</li>
<li>The probability that H₀ is true</li>
<li>A measure of the size or importance of an effect</li>
<li>A reproducibility guarantee</li>
</ul>
<p>A worked example. You’re testing whether a new moisturiser increases skin hydration vs.&nbsp;a placebo. You recruit 40 volunteers (20 per group), measure hydration at baseline and after 4 weeks, compute the difference, and run a t-test. You get p = 0.032.</p>
<p>What this means: if the ingredient truly had no effect, you’d see a difference this large or larger about 3.2% of the time by random chance alone. It’s reasonably unlikely, so you reject H₀.</p>
<p>What this doesn’t tell you: how big the effect is, whether it’s clinically meaningful, whether you’d get the same result in a different population, or whether you’ll replicate it in the next study.</p>

</section>
<section id="type-i-and-type-ii-errors" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="type-i-and-type-ii-errors">Type I and Type II errors</h2>
<p>Every statistical test makes one of four kinds of decision. The truth is binary (effect exists or not), and your conclusion is binary (significant or not). This gives a 2×2 table:</p>
<table class="caption-top table">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 33%">
<col style="width: 33%">
<col style="width: 33%">
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th></th>
<th>H₀ true (no effect)</th>
<th>H₀ false (effect exists)</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>Test significant</strong></td>
<td>False positive (Type I, α)</td>
<td>True positive (power)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><strong>Test not significant</strong></td>
<td>True negative</td>
<td>False negative (Type II, β)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>Type I error (α):</strong> You conclude there’s an effect when there isn’t one. The false alarm. By convention, α = 0.05, meaning you accept a 5% chance of this per test.</p>
<p><strong>Type II error (β):</strong> You miss a real effect. The missed detection. Power = 1 − β. A study with 80% power has a 20% chance of missing a real effect of the specified size.</p>
<p>The fire alarm analogy: α is the rate at which the alarm goes off when there’s no fire. β is the rate at which there’s a fire and the alarm doesn’t go off. You want both low. They trade off against each other for a fixed sample size.</p>
<p>From these four cells you can derive four quantities that are far more useful than p-values in applied work:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sensitivity</strong> = TP / (TP + FN) — probability the test fires when the effect is real</li>
<li><strong>Specificity</strong> = TN / (TN + FP) — probability the test stays quiet when there’s no effect</li>
<li><strong>PPV</strong> (positive predictive value) = TP / (TP + FP) — probability the effect is real given significance</li>
<li><strong>NPV</strong> (negative predictive value) = TN / (TN + FN) — probability there’s no effect given non-significance</li>
</ul>
<p>PPV is the one people most often forget to think about. In a field where most tested hypotheses are false (say, early-stage drug screening), even a specific test produces a lot of false positives. This is part of the replication crisis.</p>

<section id="choosing-the-right-test" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="choosing-the-right-test">Choosing the right test</h2>
<p>The most common source of error is not the calculation — R will do that correctly. It’s choosing the wrong test for the question. Here’s the key decision table:</p>
<table class="caption-top table">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 33%">

<col style="width: 33%">

<p>Three questions to navigate this table:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>What is your outcome variable?</strong> Continuous, binary, count, or ordinal?</li>
<li><strong>How many groups are you comparing?</strong> Two or more?</li>
<li><strong>Are observations independent?</strong> Or paired/repeated?</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’re unsure whether your data is “normal enough” for a parametric test: with n ≥ 30 per group, the central limit theorem covers you for most practical purposes. Below 30, check with a QQ-plot (<code>qqnorm()</code> + <code>qqline()</code>) and use a non-parametric alternative if in doubt. The non-parametric versions lose some power but make fewer assumptions.</p>
<hr>
</section>
<section id="the-regression-family" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-regression-family">The regression family</h2>
<p>Tests of means and proportions cover simple comparisons. When you have multiple predictors, covariates to control for, or a continuous outcome you want to model, you need regression.</p>
<section id="linear-regression" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="linear-regression">Linear regression</h3>
<p>Models a continuous outcome as a linear function of one or more predictors. Use when: your outcome is continuous and approximately normal given the predictors. The fundamental model is <code>lm(outcome ~ predictor1 + predictor2, data = df)</code>. Interactions between two variables are added with <code>*</code>: <code>lm(outcome ~ A * B)</code> fits main effects for A and B plus the A×B interaction.</p>
<p>The assumptions to check: residuals normally distributed (QQ-plot of residuals), constant variance (residuals vs.&nbsp;fitted values plot), no multicollinearity among predictors (variance inflation factor). Missing any of these doesn’t make the coefficients wrong — it makes the standard errors and p-values wrong.</p>
</section>
<section id="logistic-regression" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="logistic-regression">Logistic regression</h3>
<p>When your outcome is binary (success/failure, present/absent), linear regression is inappropriate — it predicts outside [0, 1] and the residuals are non-normal by construction. Logistic regression models the log-odds of the outcome. In R: <code>glm(outcome ~ predictors, family = binomial)</code>. Coefficients are on the log-odds scale; exponentiate them (<code>exp(coef(model))</code>) to get odds ratios, which are more interpretable.</p>
<p>The key assumption that’s often violated: logistic regression requires approximately 10 outcome events per predictor variable. If you have 50 cases of a disease and 8 predictors, you’re on the edge. Be conservative.</p>
</section>
<section id="mixed-models" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mixed-models">Mixed models</h3>
<p>When observations are not independent — repeated measures on the same subjects, patients nested within hospitals, batches within production runs — standard regression underestimates uncertainty because it ignores the correlation structure. Mixed models (also called multilevel or hierarchical models) handle this by estimating both fixed effects (the parameters you care about) and random effects (the structure that creates correlation).</p>
<p>In R, <code>lme4::lmer()</code> for continuous outcomes and <code>lme4::glmer()</code> for binary. These models require more thought to specify correctly — but using a standard regression when you have clustered data is not a conservative choice, it’s a wrong one.</p>
<hr>
</section>
</section>
<section id="what-p-values-dont-tell-you" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-p-values-dont-tell-you">What p-values don’t tell you</h2>
<section id="effect-size" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="effect-size">Effect size</h3>
<p>A p-value tells you whether an effect is detectable. Effect size tells you whether it matters. With large enough n, any effect, no matter how trivially small, will be statistically significant. Standard effect size measures:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cohen’s d</strong> for mean differences: d = (μ₁ − μ₂) / pooled SD. Small = 0.2, medium = 0.5, large = 0.8.</li>
<li><strong>η²</strong> (eta-squared) for ANOVA: proportion of variance explained.</li>
<li><strong>Odds ratio</strong> for logistic regression: how much more likely the outcome is per unit increase in a predictor.</li>
</ul>
<p>Always report effect sizes alongside p-values. “Statistically significant, p = 0.03” without an effect size is an incomplete result.</p>
</section>
<section id="confidence-intervals" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="confidence-intervals">Confidence intervals</h3>
<p>A 95% confidence interval is a range of plausible values for the true parameter. It’s constructed so that, under repeated sampling, 95% of intervals computed this way would contain the true value. A wide confidence interval — even if it excludes zero — tells you the estimate is imprecise. In clinical or formulation work, precision matters as much as significance.</p>
<p>The confidence interval carries more information than the p-value. It tells you the direction, the magnitude, and the precision of the estimate simultaneously.</p>
</section>
<section id="multiple-comparisons" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="multiple-comparisons">Multiple comparisons</h3>
<p>Every test you run at α = 0.05 has a 5% false positive rate. Run 20 tests and you expect one false positive just by chance. This is not a hypothetical problem — it’s routine in omics data, sensory profiling panels, and screening experiments.</p>
<p>Common corrections:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bonferroni</strong>: divide α by the number of tests. Conservative but simple.</li>
<li><strong>Benjamini-Hochberg (FDR)</strong>: controls the expected proportion of false positives among significant results. Less conservative, more appropriate for discovery contexts.</li>
</ul>
<p>In R: <code>p.adjust(p_values, method = "BH")</code> for Benjamini-Hochberg. Use it whenever you’re reporting more than 5 or so tests simultaneously.</p>
<hr>
</section>
</section>
<section id="roc-curves" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="roc-curves">ROC curves</h2>
<p>When you have a continuous classifier (a model score, a biomarker value, a threshold parameter) and a binary outcome, the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve shows the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity across all possible thresholds.</p>
<p>The area under the ROC curve (AUC) summarises classifier performance in a single number. AUC = 0.5 is a random classifier. AUC = 1.0 is a perfect classifier. In practice:</p>
<ul>
<li>AUC &gt; 0.9: excellent discrimination</li>
<li>AUC 0.7–0.9: acceptable</li>
<li>AUC 0.5–0.7: poor</li>
</ul>
<p>In R: <code>pROC::roc(outcome, score)</code> then <code>auc()</code>. The ROC curve is useful precisely because it’s threshold-agnostic — you can choose the operating threshold based on your acceptable trade-off between false positives and false negatives after seeing the curve, rather than committing upfront.</p>
<p>One caution: AUC is an average over all thresholds. In some applications (rare event detection, high-cost false positives), the area under the precision-recall curve is more informative.</p>
<hr>
</section>
<section id="quick-reference-glossary" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="quick-reference-glossary">Quick reference glossary</h2>
<p><strong>p-value</strong> — Probability of observing data this extreme or more extreme, given H₀ is true. Not the probability that H₀ is true.</p>
<p><strong>Null hypothesis (H₀)</strong> — The baseline assumption of no effect, no difference, no relationship.</p>
<p><strong>Type I error (α)</strong> — Rejecting H₀ when it’s true. False positive. Conventionally set to 0.05.</p>
<p><strong>Type II error (β)</strong> — Failing to reject H₀ when it’s false. False negative. Power = 1 − β.</p>
<p><strong>Power</strong> — Probability of detecting a true effect of a given size. Increases with sample size and effect size, decreases with variance.</p>
<p><strong>Effect size</strong> — A standardised measure of the magnitude of an effect, independent of sample size.</p>
<p><strong>Confidence interval</strong> — A range of plausible values for the true parameter. Width reflects estimation precision.</p>
<p><strong>ANOVA</strong> — Analysis of variance. Tests whether at least one group mean differs from the others. Does not tell you which groups differ — you need post-hoc tests (e.g.&nbsp;Tukey HSD) for that.</p>
<p><strong>Odds ratio</strong> — In logistic regression, the multiplicative change in the odds of the outcome per unit increase in a predictor. OR = 1 means no effect. OR &gt; 1 means increased odds. OR &lt; 1 means decreased odds.</p>
<p><strong>FDR</strong> — False discovery rate. The expected proportion of significant results that are false positives. Used when running many tests simultaneously (genomics, screening, sensory analysis).</p>

  <title>The Reproducibility Quest: Modern Tools for R and Python Data Science</title>
  <dc:creator>Antoine Lucas</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="introduction" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Reproducibility is the cornerstone of credible data science. Whether you’re in academia, pharma, finance, or tech, the ability to recreate your analysis environment and results is essential. Yet achieving true reproducibility has historically been painful — a maze of version conflicts, missing dependencies, and the dreaded “works on my machine” syndrome.</p>
<p>The good news? We’re living in a golden age of reproducibility tooling. Both R and Python ecosystems have evolved dramatically, offering modern solutions that make reproducible workflows not just possible, but practical. This post covers the complete picture: from setting up a solid development environment in the first place, through package management and containerization, to what reproducibility actually requires when you’re working under regulatory constraints.</p>
<p>But before diving into tools, let’s address a crucial question: <strong>how much reproducibility do you actually need?</strong></p>
<hr>
</section>
<section id="setting-up-your-environment" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="setting-up-your-environment">Setting Up Your Environment</h2>
<p>Before you can have a reproducible workflow, you need a consistent development environment. This matters more than most people realise — subtle differences between machines (R versions, system libraries, editor settings) cause problems that are hard to debug and impossible to prevent without a baseline setup.</p>
<section id="vs-code-as-your-polyglot-ide" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="vs-code-as-your-polyglot-ide">VS Code as your polyglot IDE</h3>
<p>If you write both R and Python, VS Code is the only reasonable choice. RStudio is excellent for pure R work but does not handle Python well. PyCharm goes the other way. VS Code handles both, plus Quarto, plus Bash, plus whatever else you need.</p>
<p>The extensions that actually matter for a data science setup:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>R:</strong> <code>air</code> — a Rust-based formatter from Posit. Fast, opinionated, and it replaces <code>styler</code>. Never use <code>formatR</code>. Configure via <code>air.toml</code> at project root.</li>
<li><strong>Python:</strong> <code>ruff</code> — formatter and linter in one. Replaces <code>black</code>, <code>isort</code>, <code>flake8</code>. Configure via <code>pyproject.toml</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both integrate with VS Code for format-on-save. This matters for reproducibility in a non-obvious way: consistent formatting means diffs are about logic, not whitespace, which makes code review and change tracking actually useful.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="notebooks-marimo-over-jupyter">Notebooks: marimo over Jupyter</h3>
<p>If you write Python notebooks, <a href="https://marimo.io/">marimo</a> is worth evaluating. It’s reactive (cells re-execute when their dependencies change), stores notebooks as pure Python scripts (Git-friendly, no JSON blob), and has a better story for reproducibility than classical Jupyter. For R, Quarto documents are the right answer for anything that isn’t pure exploration.</p>

<p>Every level of reproducibility adds friction:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>L1→L2</strong>: Writing documentation (minutes)</li>
<li><strong>L2→L3</strong>: Managing lockfiles, occasional dependency conflicts (hours)</li>
<li><strong>L3→L4</strong>: Container setup, debugging build issues (days initially)</li>
<li><strong>L4→L5</strong>: Data versioning, workflow management, CI/CD (ongoing effort)</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://quarto.org/">Quarto</a> unifies documentation across R, Python, and Julia. A typical Quarto document combines markdown narrative with code chunks in either language.</p>
<p>Key reproducibility feature: With <code>freeze: auto</code> in your YAML header, Quarto caches computational outputs, so documents can be re-rendered without re-executing all code — improving both reproducibility and build times.</p>
<p>Quarto documents use fenced code blocks with language specifiers like <code>{python}</code> or <code>{r}</code> to indicate executable code, and can output to HTML, PDF, Word, and many other formats.</p>

<p>The key insight: <strong>match your investment to your actual needs</strong>. Over-engineering reproducibility for a throwaway analysis wastes time. Under-engineering for a regulatory submission creates risk.</p>
<p>As project risk and longevity increase, so should your reproducibility investment — from L1 (personal exploration) through L5 (regulatory/clinical).</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="regulated-environments-reproducibility-in-pharma-and-gxp">Regulated Environments: Reproducibility in Pharma and GxP</h2>
<p>Everything above applies to all data science work. But if you operate in a regulated environment — pharma, medical devices, clinical research — there are additional requirements that change the calculus significantly.</p>
<section id="what-fda-and-ema-actually-expect" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-fda-and-ema-actually-expect">What FDA and EMA actually expect</h3>
<p>The FDA’s 21 CFR Part 11 and EMA’s comparable guidance don’t prescribe specific tools. What they require is an audit trail: given a result in a regulatory submission, you must be able to demonstrate exactly which code, which data, and which environment produced it — and reproduce it on demand.</p>
<p>In practice, this means:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Every analysis is traceable to a specific software version.</strong> Not “R 4.x”, but “R 4.4.2 with renv lockfile pinned to commit <code>abc123</code>”.</li>
<li><strong>Changes are documented.</strong> A git history is not optional; it’s part of the validation evidence.</li>
<li><strong>The environment is validated.</strong> IQ (Installation Qualification), OQ (Operational Qualification), PQ (Performance Qualification) aren’t bureaucratic theatre — they’re the documented proof that your platform behaves as expected.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sessioninfo-is-necessary-but-not-sufficient">sessionInfo() is necessary but not sufficient</h3>
<p><code>sessionInfo()</code> is the minimum. It tells you what packages were loaded in the R session at the time of analysis. Include it at the end of every regulatory-grade report:</p>

<li><strong>renv</strong> — lockfile in the repository, pinned to an exact snapshot date. <code>renv::restore()</code> gives any auditor the exact library used in production.</li>
<li><strong>Docker</strong> — the base image is pinned (<code>rocker/r-ver:4.4.2</code>, not <code>rocker/r-ver:latest</code>). This ensures system libraries are frozen, not just R packages.</li>
<li><strong>GitHub Actions</strong> — CI runs the test suite and renders key reports on every push. The green CI badge is part of the OQ evidence.</li>
<li><strong>Posit Connect</strong> — deployment is version-controlled. Each deployed bundle has a manifest and can be rolled back.</li>
</ol>
<p>The IQ document answers: <em>“Is the software correctly installed?”</em> — covered by the Docker image build log and the <code>renv::restore()</code> log.</p>
<p>The OQ document answers: <em>“Does it perform as specified?”</em> — covered by the automated test suite.</p>
<p>The PQ document answers: <em>“Does it perform as required in production?”</em> — covered by UAT sign-off and monitoring dashboards.</p>
<p>This isn’t a heavy process once it’s set up. The overhead is in the documentation, not the tooling. The tooling is Git, renv, Docker, and a CI runner — none of which require purchasing a validated platform.</p>

<p>If you’re not running a full validated platform but still need to produce defensible analyses (clinical biostatistics reports, ingredient safety dossiers, etc.):</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Git</strong> — every script in version control, analysis tied to a commit hash</li>
<li><strong>renv</strong> — lockfile committed alongside the code</li>
<li><strong><code>sessionInfo()</code> in every report</strong> — as a footer, not optional</li>
<li><strong>Quarto with <code>freeze: auto</code></strong> — computational outputs frozen and committed; the rendered report is reproducible without re-executing</li>
</ol>
<p>This gets you to L3/L4 on the reproducibility spectrum at low overhead. It won’t satisfy IQ/OQ/PQ for a validated system, but it satisfies the traceability requirement for analytical work and will hold up to a reasonably thorough audit.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Reproducibility is no longer optional — it’s table stakes for professional data science. The tooling has matured to the point where reproducible workflows are not just possible but practical.</p>
<p>But remember: <strong>reproducibility is a spectrum, not a binary</strong>. The right approach depends on your context — who needs to reproduce the work, for how long, and at what stakes.</p>
<p>Start with package management (<code>uv</code> for Python, <code>rv</code> or <code>renv</code> for R), add language version control (<code>rig</code>, <code>uv python</code>), and when system dependencies become complex, embrace devcontainers. Layer in workflow tools like <code>targets</code> or Snakemake for complex pipelines, and document everything with Quarto.</p>
<p>The investment in reproducibility pays dividends: faster onboarding, fewer “works on my machine” incidents, easier debugging, and the confidence that your results can be verified and trusted. Just make sure you’re investing the right amount for your actual needs.</p>

  <title>Reproducible Environments for Everyone: DevContainers for Data Science Teams</title>

<section id="the-problem" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-problem">The problem</h2>
<p>“It works on my machine” is an old joke in software engineering. In data science teams it’s still a weekly occurrence, and it’s worse because the people affected are often not software engineers. A biostatistician or computational biologist should not need to spend two hours debugging a Quarto render failure caused by a missing system dependency or a mismatched R version.</p>
<p>The gap between “the analysis worked on the statistician’s laptop” and “the analysis can be reproduced six months later by a different person” is a real reproducibility problem in R&amp;D contexts. <code>renv</code> locks R packages. <code>uv</code> locks Python packages. But neither handles the runtime environment: R version, system libraries, Quarto CLI version, or the formatter that enforces code style.</p>
<p>DevContainers solve this layer. Every team member opens the project and gets exactly the same environment — the same R version, the same tools, the same VS Code configuration — in one click, without any manual setup.</p>
<hr>
</section>
<section id="terminology" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="terminology">Terminology</h2>
<p>A <strong>devcontainer</strong> is a Docker container configured specifically for development. The <a href="https://containers.dev/">Dev Container specification</a> defines a <code>devcontainer.json</code> file that tells VS Code (or any compatible tool) how to build or pull a container image and configure the development environment inside it.</p>
<p>Key concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><code>devcontainer.json</code></strong> — the configuration file at <code>.devcontainer/devcontainer.json</code>. Specifies the image, features to install, VS Code extensions, and editor settings.</li>
<li><strong>Devcontainer features</strong> — composable installation units. Each feature is a self-contained script that installs a specific tool or set of tools into the container. Features can be published to GHCR or kept as local scripts.</li>
<li><strong>Pre-built image vs.&nbsp;build-on-open</strong> — you can either reference a pre-built Docker image (<code>"image": "ghcr.io/..."</code>) or define a <code>Dockerfile</code> and build the image when the devcontainer opens. Pre-built is faster and more reproducible; build-on-open is useful during development of the image itself.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
</section>
<section id="pre-built-image-strategy" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pre-built-image-strategy">Pre-built image strategy</h2>
<p>The most important decision in a devcontainer setup for a team is: <strong>pre-build the image</strong>. If every team member rebuilds the image on first open, you pay the build cost repeatedly (10–20 minutes for a full R + Python image is not unusual), and you risk divergence when upstream base images change.</p>
<p>The strategy:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Define a <code>Dockerfile</code> — often a single line</li>
<li>Configure a CI workflow that builds and pushes the image to GHCR on changes to <code>.devcontainer/**</code></li>
<li>Reference the pre-built image in <code>devcontainer.json</code> with a <code>build</code> fallback for first-time setup</li>
</ol>
<p>The <code>Dockerfile</code> for this setup is literally one line (plus a build arg for flexibility):</p>
<div class="code-copy-outer-scaffold"><div class="sourceCode" id="cb1" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode dockerfile code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode dockerfile"><span id="cb1-1"><span class="kw" style="color: #003B4F;

background-color: null;
font-weight: bold;
font-style: inherit;">FROM</span> ${IMAGE}</span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>The base image (<code>ghcr.io/r-lib/rig/r:latest</code>) is maintained by the <code>rig</code> project and provides a clean Ubuntu image with R installed via <code>rig</code>. Everything else — Quarto, Python, uv, air, R packages — is layered on by devcontainer features.</p>
<p>The CI workflow (<code>.github/workflows/build-push.yml</code>) handles building and publishing:</p>

<p>A few things worth noting:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Multi-platform build</strong> (<code>linux/amd64,linux/arm64</code>) ensures the image works on both Intel/AMD machines and Apple Silicon Macs without emulation.</li>
<li><strong>GHA layer cache</strong> (<code>cache-from/to: type=gha</code>) cuts rebuild time significantly — typically from 15+ minutes to 2–3 minutes on incremental changes.</li>
<li><strong>SHA tags</strong> (<code>type=sha,prefix=sha-</code>) give you immutable image references for pinning. <code>latest</code> is convenient; <code>sha-abc1234</code> is reproducible.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="custom-local-feature">Custom local feature</h2>
<p>The devcontainer features ecosystem has hundreds of published features for common tools. But for project-specific combinations, a <strong>local feature</strong> — stored in your repository under <code>./features/</code> — is the right approach. It gives you full control without the overhead of publishing to GHCR.</p>
<p>My local feature (<code>./features/quarto-computing-dependencies</code>) installs the full computing stack needed for Quarto-based R + Python data science:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>uv</strong> — Python package manager (Astral). Installed system-wide to <code>/usr/local/bin</code>.</li>
<li><strong>air</strong> — R formatter CLI (Posit). The same formatter the VS Code extension uses, available in the terminal and CI.</li>
<li><strong>jarl</strong> — R linter CLI. Lightweight, fast, pairs well with air.</li>
<li><strong>R packages</strong> — installed via <code>pak</code>, supports both CRAN names and GitHub refs (<code>user/repo@tag</code>).</li>
<li><strong>Python packages</strong> — installed system-wide via <code>uv pip install --system</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The feature’s <code>devcontainer-feature.json</code> defines its options:</p>

<p>Installing as the non-root remote user (<code>su "${USERNAME}"</code>) matters here — R packages installed as root end up in a system library that can conflict with <code>renv</code>.</p>
<p>The composability is the main benefit of the feature pattern. You can use this same feature across different projects, passing different <code>rDeps</code> and <code>pythonDeps</code> strings without duplicating installation logic.</p>

<p>Key choices:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>"image"</code> references the pre-built image. The <code>"build"</code> block is a fallback — if the image pull fails (first-time setup, network issue), VS Code falls back to building locally.</li>
<li><code>"remoteUser": "vscode"</code> — the non-root user that runs in the container. R packages and uv installs respect this.</li>
<li>The <code>quarto-cli</code> feature installs TinyTeX (<code>installTinyTex: "true"</code>) so PDF output works without any additional setup.</li>
<li><code>"r.useRenvLibPath": true</code> — tells the R VS Code extension to use the project’s <code>renv</code> library, so <code>renv::restore()</code> and the extension’s package index stay in sync.</li>
<li>Format-on-save is enabled for both R (air) and Python (ruff). This is not optional — it enforces consistent style automatically without anyone having to think about it.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="making-it-work-for-non-developers">Making it work for non-developers</h2>
<p>The setup above sounds like a lot of infrastructure. The experience from the user’s side is:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Install VS Code and the Dev Containers extension (<code>ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers</code>).</li>
<li>Install Docker Desktop.</li>
<li>Open the project folder in VS Code.</li>
<li>Click “Reopen in Container” when prompted.</li>
<li>Wait ~2 minutes for the pre-built image to pull and features to install (first time only; subsequent opens are instant).</li>
<li>Work normally.</li>
</ol>
<p>That’s it. No <code>install.packages()</code>, no Python virtualenv management, no Quarto CLI version mismatch, no TinyTeX setup. The environment is identical to everyone else’s on the team.</p>
<p>For a team of biostatisticians or computational biologists who are comfortable with R but not with devops tooling, this is a significant reduction in onboarding friction. The alternative is a 10-page “Environment Setup” document that is never fully correct.</p>

<section id="cicd-for-the-image" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cicd-for-the-image">CI/CD for the image</h2>
<p>The <code>build-push.yml</code> workflow deserves a closer look, because this is where the reproducibility guarantee is maintained over time.</p>
<p>The workflow triggers on any change to <code>.devcontainer/**</code> — meaning whenever you update <code>devcontainer.json</code>, the <code>Dockerfile</code>, or the local feature scripts, a new image is built and pushed. Team members get the updated environment on their next container rebuild.</p>
<p>The multi-platform build (<code>linux/amd64,linux/arm64</code>) handles the growing heterogeneity of developer hardware. If you skip this, Apple Silicon users either get emulation (slow) or a different image (not reproducible). Buildx with <code>docker/build-push-action@v6</code> handles cross-compilation transparently.</p>
<p>GHA layer caching (<code>type=gha</code>) is essential for iteration speed. The base image layers are cached; only the changed layers rebuild. A change to <code>install.sh</code> that only modifies the R package list typically rebuilds in under 3 minutes rather than 15.</p>

<section id="practical-tips" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="practical-tips">Practical tips</h2>
<p><strong>Pin image tags in production.</strong> The <code>devcontainer.json</code> above uses <code>latest</code>. This is convenient for development — you always get the newest image. For a project that needs to be reproducible for audit or regulatory purposes, pin to a SHA tag:</p>
<div class="code-copy-outer-scaffold"><div class="sourceCode" id="cb6" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode json code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode json"><span id="cb6-1"><span class="er" style="color: #AD0000;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">"image":</span> <span class="er" style="color: #AD0000;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">"ghcr.io/antoinelucasfra/quarto-devcontainer:sha-abc1234"</span></span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>SHA tags are generated automatically by <code>docker/metadata-action</code> on every build. Find the right tag in your GHCR package page.</p>
<p><strong>Test with the <code>devcontainer</code> CLI.</strong> Before pushing changes to the feature or image, test locally:</p>
<div class="code-copy-outer-scaffold"><div class="sourceCode" id="cb7" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode bash code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span id="cb7-1"><span class="ex" style="color: null;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">npm</span> install <span class="at" style="color: #657422;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">-g</span> @devcontainers/cli</span>
<span id="cb7-2"><span class="ex" style="color: null;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">devcontainer</span> build <span class="at" style="color: #657422;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">--workspace-folder</span> .</span>
<span id="cb7-3"><span class="ex" style="color: null;

background-color: null;

<p>This catches errors in <code>install.sh</code> without triggering a full CI build.</p>
<p><strong>Iterate on the feature without rebuilding the full image.</strong> If you’re modifying <code>install.sh</code> frequently, comment out the <code>"image"</code> line temporarily and use only the <code>"build"</code> block. This rebuilds from the base image each time, which is slower but lets you test feature changes without publishing to GHCR.</p>
<p><strong>Keep <code>renv.lock</code> and the devcontainer in sync.</strong> The devcontainer installs a baseline set of R packages. Project-specific packages live in <code>renv.lock</code>. When <code>renv::restore()</code> runs inside the container, it installs on top of the baseline. This separation works well — the baseline handles heavy system dependencies (like <code>tidyverse</code>, which takes several minutes to compile from source), while <code>renv</code> handles project-specific versioned packages quickly.</p>

<section id="honest-preamble" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="honest-preamble">Honest preamble</h2>
<p>This is not a “become a 10x developer with AI” post. I’ve been using LLM-assisted tools daily for over a year across pharma, biotech, and cosmetics R&amp;D contexts, and the reality is more nuanced than the hype suggests.</p>
<p>The genuine gains: faster boilerplate, quicker navigation of unfamiliar APIs, less context-switching when writing documentation. The real failure modes: overconfidence in generated statistical logic, package version hallucinations, and a subtle drift toward writing code you don’t fully understand because it looked plausible.</p>
<p>My stack has settled into three layers, each with a different trust level and appropriate use case. I’ll walk through each one, then close with the things I’ve learned not to delegate to a model.</p>
<hr>
</section>
<section id="the-three-layer-stack" class="level2">

<p>Each layer has a different footprint. Copilot is always on — it suggests as you type. OpenCode operates at the repository level, understanding file structure and multi-step tasks. Ollama stays on-device, which matters when you’re working with patient data or proprietary formulations.</p>

<section id="setup" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="setup">Setup</h3>
<p>Install two extensions in VS Code:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>GitHub.copilot</code> — inline completions</li>
<li><code>GitHub.copilot-chat</code> — sidebar chat and inline <code>/explain</code>, <code>/fix</code>, <code>/doc</code></li>
</ul>
<p>That’s it. The defaults are good. The one thing worth doing immediately is writing a <code>.github/copilot-instructions.md</code> file at your project root.</p>
</section>
<section id="copilot-instructions.md" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="copilot-instructions.md"><code>copilot-instructions.md</code></h3>
<p>This file is the most underused feature of Copilot. It is injected into every chat prompt and shapes completions without you having to re-explain context. For a typical R + Python data science project, mine looks like this:</p>

<p>The effect is immediate. Copilot stops suggesting <code>library(ggplot2)</code> when you already have a <code>tidyverse</code> import pattern, and it stops proposing base R testing functions when your project conventions are explicit.</p>
</section>
<section id="inline-completions" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="inline-completions">Inline completions</h3>
<p>A few patterns that work well:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data wrangling skeletons.</strong> Start typing <code>df |&gt; filter(</code> and Copilot will often complete the condition correctly from context. Accept with Tab, verify the column name.</li>
<li><strong>Test stubs.</strong> Write the function name and a comment like <code># Test: returns NA for empty input</code>, then let Copilot draft the <code>testthat::test_that()</code> block.</li>
<li><strong>Docstrings.</strong> Place the cursor above a function definition and type <code>#'</code> — Copilot completes the roxygen skeleton from the function signature.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="where-copilot-earns-its-keep" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="where-copilot-earns-its-keep">Where Copilot earns its keep</h3>
<ul>
<li>Boilerplate ggplot2 themes and axis formatting</li>
<li><code>dplyr</code>/<code>tidyr</code> pipelines for reshaping</li>
<li>Writing repetitive unit tests once you’ve shown the pattern</li>
<li>SQL query generation from a clear English description</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="where-it-fails" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="where-it-fails">Where it fails</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Statistical model selection.</strong> Do not ask Copilot whether to use a mixed model or a GEE for your longitudinal data. It will give you a plausible-sounding answer that may be wrong for your specific design. This requires domain judgment.</li>
<li><strong>P-value interpretation.</strong> I’ve seen Copilot generate commentary like “the result is highly significant (p = 0.03)” in a context where 0.03 is borderline given the multiple testing burden. It doesn’t know your correction strategy.</li>
<li><strong>Regulatory logic.</strong> Any code that feeds into a regulatory document needs human-authored logic. Don’t let Copilot scaffold the decision rules.</li>
</ul>

<section id="opencode" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="opencode">OpenCode</h2>
<p><a href="https://opencode.ai">OpenCode</a> is a terminal-based agentic coding assistant. Where Copilot works at the line or block level, OpenCode operates across files and repositories. It can read your project structure, write new files, run commands, and execute multi-step tasks from a single prompt.</p>
<p>The key difference in practice: Copilot completes what you’re typing. OpenCode acts on what you describe.</p>
<section id="agents.md" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="agents.md"><code>AGENTS.md</code></h3>
<p>The same principle as <code>copilot-instructions.md</code> applies here, but with more scope. OpenCode reads <code>AGENTS.md</code> at the project root (and any subdirectory <code>AGENTS.md</code> files) to understand context, conventions, and constraints. A minimal but useful template:</p>

<section id="workflow-patterns-that-work" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="workflow-patterns-that-work">Workflow patterns that work</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scaffolding a new module.</strong> “Create an R script that reads a CSV, validates column types, and returns a cleaned tibble. Use our standard error handling pattern from <code>R/utils.R</code>.” OpenCode reads <code>utils.R</code> and applies the pattern.</li>
<li><strong>Refactoring.</strong> “Refactor all uses of <code>read.csv()</code> to <code>readr::read_csv()</code> across the project, and update the function signatures to use <code>col_types</code> explicitly.” Multi-file, handles it.</li>
<li><strong>Test generation.</strong> “Write <code>testthat</code> tests for every exported function in <code>R/analysis.R</code>. Each test should cover the happy path and one edge case.”</li>
<li><strong>Documentation passes.</strong> “Add roxygen2 documentation to all undocumented functions in <code>R/</code>.”</li>

<section id="when-copilot-is-better" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="when-copilot-is-better">When Copilot is better</h3>
<p>OpenCode has overhead. For single-line completions, tab-completing a dplyr pipeline, or quickly looking up a function signature — Copilot is faster. Use OpenCode when the task has enough scope that describing it in prose is more efficient than typing it yourself.</p>

<section id="ollama" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ollama">Ollama</h2>
<p>Ollama runs LLMs locally. No data leaves your machine. For teams working with clinical trial data, patient samples, proprietary formulations, or anything subject to GDPR or GxP data governance, this matters.</p>
<p>Cloud LLM providers — including GitHub Copilot — process your code on external servers. In most enterprise pharma environments, this is either explicitly prohibited or sits in a legal grey zone. Ollama sidesteps this entirely.</p>

<p>Local models at 14–16B parameters are meaningfully behind frontier cloud models (GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet) on complex reasoning, long-context tasks, and nuanced code generation. On a 16GB laptop, <code>deepseek-coder-v2</code> is noticeably slower than Copilot and produces more corrections-needed output.</p>
<p>The trade-off is clear: if your data governance constraints are real, the capability gap is the price you pay. For boilerplate generation on non-sensitive projects, the gap is small enough to be acceptable.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Write <code>AGENTS.md</code> and <code>copilot-instructions.md</code> before writing any prompts.</strong> Five minutes of upfront context saves hours of correction downstream.</li>
<li><strong>Use AI for the first 80% of boilerplate.</strong> The last 20% — the logic that’s specific to your domain — write yourself.</li>
<li><strong>Read every diff before accepting.</strong> Every single one. This is not optional. Models produce plausible-looking errors.</li>
<li><strong>Write your tests against your own spec, then use AI to fill in the test bodies.</strong> Never let AI define what “correct” means for your analysis.</li>
<li><strong>Treat AI output as a junior PR.</strong> You’d review a junior colleague’s code carefully. Same standard applies.</li>

<section id="dont" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="dont">Don’t</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Delegate statistical test or model selection.</strong> This requires domain knowledge the model does not have — experimental design, distributional assumptions, multiple testing context.</li>
<li><strong>Use cloud tools on patient data, proprietary formulations, or anything under NDA.</strong> Even if the provider claims not to train on your data, your organization’s data governance policy likely has an opinion.</li>
<li><strong>Accept code you don’t understand.</strong> If you can’t explain what a generated block does, you cannot debug it when it breaks in production.</li>
<li><strong>Rely on AI for package version advice.</strong> Training cutoffs mean models routinely suggest deprecated APIs. Always check the current documentation.</li>
<li><strong>Use AI to draft regulatory documents without expert review.</strong> ICH E9, ISO 14971, 21 CFR Part 11 — these are not contexts for generated text without thorough human authorship and review.</li>

<section id="the-deeper-question" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-deeper-question">The deeper question</h2>
<p>The most significant shift LLM tools have introduced is not writing speed — it’s the reading-to-writing ratio. A larger fraction of programming time is now spent reading and evaluating generated code rather than writing from scratch. This is not obviously an improvement. Writing forces you to think through the logic. Reading generated output creates a plausible-enough illusion of understanding that can be hard to distinguish from the real thing.</p>
<p>There is a cognitive load trap. When a model produces a correct-looking solution quickly, it is easy to accept it without the slower thinking that would catch a subtle statistical error or an off-by-one in a loop. The speed gain is real; the risk is that you externalize the thinking that was doing useful work.</p>
<p>The reproducibility paradox is related: you can reproduce the output (run the code again, get the same result), but you often cannot reproduce the reasoning. Why was this model chosen? Why this correction method? If the answer is “the AI suggested it,” that’s not a defensible answer in a regulated context, and it’s not a good answer in a scientific one either.</p>
<p>My honest read on where this leaves data scientists: the value of domain judgment has increased, not decreased. Anyone can now produce working boilerplate quickly. What differentiates good analytical work is the judgment about what question to ask, what method is appropriate, and what the result actually means — none of which AI tools handle well. Junior data scientists may find AI tools make them look more productive while slowing their development of that judgment. Senior practitioners benefit most, because they have the domain knowledge to catch the errors and direct the tools effectively.</p>
<p>Use the tools. Read everything they produce. Keep the judgment to yourself.</p>

  <title>Staying Current in a Fast-Moving Field: Why I Built a Resources Catalog</title>
  <dc:creator>Antoine Lucas</dc:creator>
  <link>https://antoinelucasfra.github.io/posts/why-curate-resources/</link>
  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="the-knowledge-debt-problem" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-knowledge-debt-problem">The Knowledge Debt Problem</h2>
<p>If you work in data science, statistics, machine learning, or AI, you know the feeling: you look away for a month, and suddenly there’s a new paradigm, a new library that makes your favorite tool obsolete, or a paper that fundamentally changes how we think about a problem.</p>
<p>The field moves fast. Uncomfortably fast.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Statistics</strong>: New causal inference methods, Bayesian workflows, and effect estimation techniques emerge continuously</li>
<li><strong>Machine Learning</strong>: Architecture innovations, training techniques, and interpretability methods evolve monthly</li>
<li><strong>Generative AI</strong>: The pace since 2022 has been unprecedented — LLMs, diffusion models, multimodal systems</li>
<li><strong>Tooling</strong>: Package managers, reproducibility tools, and development workflows get better every year</li>
<li><strong>Best practices</strong>: What was considered “production-ready” five years ago may now be technical debt</li>
</ul>
<p>This creates what I call <strong>knowledge debt</strong> — the gap between what you know and what’s available. Unlike technical debt, knowledge debt compounds silently. You don’t realize you’re behind until you try to solve a problem and discover everyone else is using tools you’ve never heard of.</p>

<section id="the-bookmark-graveyard" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-bookmark-graveyard">The Bookmark Graveyard</h2>
<p>Like many practitioners, I used to save interesting links in browser bookmarks. The result? Thousands of unorganized, unsearchable, forgotten URLs. A digital graveyard of good intentions.</p>
<p>The problems with bookmarks:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>No context</strong> — Why did I save this? What problem does it solve?</li>
<li><strong>No categorization</strong> — Is this about Bayesian statistics or Shiny deployment?</li>
<li><strong>No language filtering</strong> — Is this R, Python, or language-agnostic?</li>
<li><strong>No discoverability</strong> — I can’t browse by topic when exploring</li>
<li><strong>Link rot</strong> — URLs die, and I never know until I need them</li>
</ol>
<p>I needed something better: a structured, searchable, categorized collection that I could actually <em>use</em>.</p>

</section>
<section id="building-the-resources-catalog" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="building-the-resources-catalog">Building the Resources Catalog</h2>
<p>That’s why I created the <a href="../../projects/resources_catalog.html">Resources Catalog</a> — a curated collection of data science resources organized by type, language, and category.</p>
<section id="the-philosophy" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-philosophy">The Philosophy</h3>
<p>The catalog isn’t trying to be comprehensive. The internet already has “awesome lists” with thousands of links. Instead, it reflects my actual learning journey:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Books</strong> that shaped how I think about problems</li>
<li><strong>Packages</strong> that I’ve found genuinely useful in practice</li>
<li><strong>Blogs</strong> from practitioners who write thoughtfully</li>

<p>Looking at my catalog, some patterns emerge. These are the domains where staying current has the highest return on investment:</p>
<section id="statistical-methodology" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="statistical-methodology">1. Statistical Methodology</h3>
<p>Statistics isn’t static. Recent years have seen significant advances in:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Causal inference</strong>: Moving beyond correlation to actual causal claims</li>
<li><strong>Bayesian workflows</strong>: Stan, brms, and probabilistic programming</li>
<li><strong>Mixed models</strong>: Proper handling of hierarchical/longitudinal data</li>
<li><strong>Effect estimation</strong>: Beyond p-values to effect sizes and uncertainty</li>
</ul>
<p>Resources like <a href="https://github.com/rmcelreath/stat_rethinking_2022">Statistical Rethinking</a>, the <a href="https://www.r-causal.org/">R-Causal community</a>, and blogs from <a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/">Andrew Gelman</a> help me stay grounded in what statistical practice should look like.</p>

<li><strong>Transformers everywhere</strong>: From NLP to computer vision to time series</li>
<li><strong>Foundation models</strong>: Pre-trained models as starting points</li>
<li><strong>Interpretability</strong>: Understanding what models actually learn</li>
<li><strong>MLOps</strong>: Taking models from notebooks to production</li>
</ul>
<p>Resources like <a href="https://huggingface.co/">Hugging Face</a>, <a href="https://course.fast.ai/">Fast.ai</a>, and <a href="https://wandb.ai/site">Weights &amp; Biases</a> keep me connected to modern practice.</p>
</section>
<section id="generative-ai-llms" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="generative-ai-llms">3. Generative AI &amp; LLMs</h3>
<p>The post-2022 explosion requires active attention:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Model capabilities</strong>: What can LLMs actually do reliably?</li>
<li><strong>Prompt engineering</strong>: How to get useful outputs</li>
<li><strong>Integration patterns</strong>: Using LLMs in applications</li>

<p>The catalog is part of a broader learning system:</p>
<section id="capture" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="capture">1. Capture</h3>
<p>When I encounter something interesting — a blog post, a package, a paper — I add it to the catalog immediately. The friction is low: just add a row to a CSV file.</p>
</section>
<section id="categorize" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="categorize">2. Categorize</h3>
<p>Tagging forces me to think: What domain is this? What language? What problem does it solve? This metacognition helps retention.</p>
</section>
<section id="review" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="review">3. Review</h3>
<p>Periodically, I browse the catalog by category. This surfaces forgotten resources and helps me notice patterns (e.g., “I’ve saved a lot about Bayesian methods lately — maybe I should actually learn brms properly”).</p>
</section>
<section id="apply" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="apply">4. Apply</h3>
<p>The ultimate test: when facing a problem, can I find a relevant resource quickly? If yes, the system works. If not, I need to improve my categorization or add missing resources.</p>
</section>
<section id="share" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="share">5. Share</h3>
<p>Making the catalog public creates accountability. It also helps others who are on similar learning journeys.</p>

<p>Maintaining a resource collection requires a specific mindset:</p>
<section id="be-selective" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="be-selective">Be Selective</h3>
<p>Not everything deserves a spot. The catalog should answer: “If I had limited time to learn about X, where would I start?” Adding everything dilutes value.</p>
</section>
<section id="accept-impermanence" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="accept-impermanence">Accept Impermanence</h3>
<p>Links die. Tools become obsolete. The catalog needs maintenance. I periodically verify links and remove resources that are no longer relevant.</p>
</section>
<section id="embrace-serendipity" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="embrace-serendipity">Embrace Serendipity</h3>
<p>Some of the best discoveries come from browsing adjacent categories. The structured format enables this kind of exploration.</p>
</section>
<section id="balance-depth-and-breadth" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="balance-depth-and-breadth">Balance Depth and Breadth</h3>
<p>Some domains need deep coverage (statistics, R programming). Others just need a few trusted entry points (specific libraries, niche topics).</p>
<hr>
</section>
</section>
<section id="starting-your-own" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="starting-your-own">Starting Your Own</h2>
<p>If you want to build a similar system, start simple:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Choose a format</strong>: Spreadsheet, notion, obsidian, or a simple CSV like mine</li>
<li><strong>Define your categories</strong>: What domains do you care about?</li>
<li><strong>Start capturing</strong>: Add resources as you encounter them</li>
<li><strong>Review regularly</strong>: Browse your collection monthly</li>
<li><strong>Share if useful</strong>: Others might benefit; you’ll be motivated to maintain it</li>
</ol>
<p>The key insight: <strong>curation is a skill</strong>. Like any skill, it improves with practice. Your first version will be imperfect. That’s fine — iterate.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-compound-interest-of-learning">The Compound Interest of Learning</h2>
<p>Staying current isn’t about knowing everything. It’s about:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Knowing where to look</strong> when you need something</li>
<li><strong>Recognizing patterns</strong> across domains</li>
<li><strong>Building on foundations</strong> rather than starting from scratch each time</li>
<li><strong>Connecting ideas</strong> from different fields</li>
</ul>
<p>A well-maintained resource collection is infrastructure for this kind of continuous learning. It’s an investment that compounds over time.</p>
<p>The pace of change in data science, ML, and AI isn’t slowing down. Having a system to navigate that change — rather than being overwhelmed by it — is increasingly valuable.</p>
<p>Browse my <a href="../../projects/resources_catalog.html">Resources Catalog</a>. Fork it, adapt it, build your own. The goal isn’t to have <em>my</em> collection — it’s to have <em>a</em> collection that serves your learning journey.</p>

  <title>rv: The Modern R Package Manager for Reproducible Workflows</title>
  <dc:creator>Antoine Lucas</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<section id="introduction" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>I’ve been using <code>renv</code> for years to manage R dependencies, and while it gets the job done, I’ve always felt something was missing. The iterative workflow, the occasional dependency conflicts, the slow installations… it works, but it doesn’t feel <em>modern</em>.</p>
<p>Then I discovered <strong>rv</strong> — a declarative R package manager written in Rust — and it immediately clicked. If you’ve been following the Python ecosystem like I have, you’ve probably seen <a href="https://docs.astral.sh/uv/">uv</a> revolutionize Python package management. Well, <code>rv</code> brings that same philosophy to R: <strong>declarative configuration, fast execution, and true reproducibility</strong>. This is exactly what I’ve been waiting for.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-is-rv" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="what-is-rv">What is rv?</h2>
<p><code>rv</code> is an R package manager that takes a fundamentally different approach from traditional tools:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Declarative</strong> — You describe the <em>desired state</em> of your project, not the steps to get there</li>
<li><strong>Written in Rust</strong> — Compiled for speed (25x faster than alternatives in benchmarks)</li>
<li><strong>Holistic resolution</strong> — Resolves the entire dependency tree before installing anything</li>
<li><strong>Lock at install time</strong> — Captures all installation information when it happens, not retroactively</li>
</ul>

<section id="the-problem-with-iterative-installation" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-problem-with-iterative-installation">The Problem with Iterative Installation</h2>
<p>If you’ve used R long enough, you’ve probably experienced this frustration. Traditional R package management (including <code>renv</code>) follows an <strong>iterative pattern</strong>:</p>
<div class="code-copy-outer-scaffold"><div class="sourceCode" id="cb2" style="background: #f1f3f5;"><pre class="sourceCode r code-with-copy"><code class="sourceCode r"><span id="cb2-1"><span class="co" style="color: #5E5E5E;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;"># The workflow we all know too well</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">install.packages</span>(<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">"dplyr"</span>)</span>
<span id="cb2-3"><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">install.packages</span>(<span class="st" style="color: #20794D;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">"ggplot2"</span>)</span>
<span id="cb2-4"><span class="co" style="color: #5E5E5E;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;"># ... more packages ...</span></span>
<span id="cb2-5">renv<span class="sc" style="color: #5E5E5E;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">::</span><span class="fu" style="color: #4758AB;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;">snapshot</span>()  <span class="co" style="color: #5E5E5E;
background-color: null;
font-style: inherit;"># Capture state after the fact</span></span></code></pre></div></div>
<p>I’ve run into two issues with this approach more times than I can count:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Incompatible versions</strong> — Packages installed at different times may have conflicting dependencies. How many times have you had a working project break after updating one package?</li>
<li><strong>Lost context</strong> — By the time you snapshot, information about <em>how</em> packages were installed is lost. Where did that package come from again?</li>
</ol>

<p>That’s it. Seriously. <code>rv</code> resolves the complete dependency tree, ensures compatibility, installs everything, and creates a lockfile — all in one atomic operation. The first time I ran this, I was genuinely surprised at how fast it was.</p>

<p>As someone who works in both R and Python, I find the parallels between <code>rv</code> and Python’s <code>uv</code> striking — and clearly intentional:</p>

<p>Both tools share the same vision, and honestly, it’s refreshing to see R catching up:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Speed through Rust</strong> — Compiled performance beats interpreted languages</li>
<li><strong>Declarative configuration</strong> — Describe the end state, not the steps</li>
<li><strong>Reproducibility first</strong> — Lockfiles capture everything needed to recreate the environment</li>
<li><strong>Modern DX</strong> — Clear CLI, helpful error messages, predictable behavior</li>

<p>Having worked in pharma, I know how critical reproducibility is — it’s not just nice to have, it’s a regulatory requirement. The combination of declarative package management (<code>rv</code>) and explicit R version management (<code>rig</code>) solves the two problems I’ve spent countless hours debugging:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>“Works on my machine”</strong> → Lockfile captures exact package versions and sources</li>
<li><strong>“Which R version?”</strong> → <code>r_version</code> in config + <code>rig</code> for installation</li>
</ol>
<p>For regulated environments (pharma, finance, etc.), this is transformative:</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I’m genuinely excited about <code>rv</code>. It represents a paradigm shift in R package management — from iterative, reactive tooling to declarative, proactive workflows. Combined with <code>rig</code> for R version management, it finally gives us a modern development experience on par with what Python developers have enjoyed with <code>uv</code> and <code>pyenv</code>.</p>
<p>The R ecosystem is evolving, and I’m here for it. Tools like <code>rv</code>, <code>rig</code>, and <a href="https://posit-dev.github.io/air/">air</a> (the new R formatter) are bringing modern development practices to R. If you value reproducibility, speed, and developer experience like I do, give <code>rv</code> a try. I think you’ll be as impressed as I was.</p>
