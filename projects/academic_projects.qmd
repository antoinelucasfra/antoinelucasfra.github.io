### Eye-Tracking Analysis

**Technologies:** R, Statistical Modeling, Signal Processing

Analysis of eye-tracking data to understand visual attention patterns. This project involved processing gaze data, computing fixation metrics, and applying statistical methods to draw insights from visual behavior experiments.
We have conducted the project from the protocol development to the data analysis and the report writing with data harvesting using Tobii Pro Lab software and statistical analysis in R.
